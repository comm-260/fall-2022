While this is only a draft, and an official decision has not yet been issued, it is now likelier than ever that women across the country will lose the federal protections to abortion access they have been granted for nearly five decades. The draft indicates that the court will rule in favor of a Mississippi law that will ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi is one of 13 states that have created Ôtrigger laws’, which are laws that will attempt to completely ban or severely restrict abortion in the event that Roe is overturned. In these 13 states, most of which already have restrictive abortion laws, crisis pregnancy centers outnumber abortion providers at an average rate of 20 to one per capita. Crisis pregnancy centers are an important tool of the anti-abortion movement, and pose a serious risk to women nationwide, but are especially harmful in states hostile to abortion, such as those with trigger laws. Should the draft be adopted by the Supreme Court and Roe be overturned, crisis pregnancy centers will further exacerbate the many obstacles faced by women seeking abortions. # Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) Crisis pregnancy centers are clinics (or in many cases, mobile vans) that advertise a wide variety of services to pregnant women, such as free pregnancy tests, baby supplies and parenting classes. CPCs are one of the most powerful tools used by the anti-abortion movement. The vast majority of CPCs are religiously affiliated and critics argue that their goal is preventing women from seeking and obtaining abortions. In pursuit of this goal, there are many tactics employed by CPCs to get “abortion-vulnerable” women - those likely to seek an abortion - through their doors. These include the promise of services and supplies once the woman gives birth, religious propaganda, a lack of transparency on websites and over the phone about the services provided at clinics, and harmful misinformation about abortion. In recent years, CPCs have moved to further their legitimacy by giving the impression of licensed medical facilities staffed by medical professionals, when in most cases, they are not, said Shireen Rose Shakouri, deputy director of Reproaction, an organization with the mission of increasing abortion access and advancing reproductive justice. Civilian volunteers with no medical training will often wear white coats in exam rooms with women, and many will even perform ultrasounds with no medical purpose as a manipulative persuasion tool. “A big tactic of the anti-abortion movement is deception, because it has to be, or they would not survive and function. The world they are fighting for is incredibly unpopular,” said Shakouri. Many CPCs will position themselves nearby or directly next to clinics like Planned Parenthood or other known abortion providers and advertise themselves as providing similar services to these clinics. The purpose of these tactics being to mislead women seeking an abortion and hopefully have them walk through the wrong door. According to Shakouri, once inside, CPC employees provide patients with misinformation about abortion to instill fear of the procedure in women who come in seeking one. Some of the most common falsehoods about abortions spread by CPCs are that they cause breast cancer, prevent women from getting pregnant again, that surgical abortions are extremely risky surgeries, and that they lead to serious psychological damage or Ôpost-abortion syndrome’. Informing women of the dangers of CPCs is an important part of Reproaction’s work, said Shakouri. The organization is home to the Fake Clinic Database, which is a database detailing every known crisis pregnancy center or fake abortion clinic in the country. The name and address are listed for each clinic, as well as a link to their website, and if they have a known affiliation with one of the larger anti-abortion umbrella organizations like Care Net or Heartbeat International. Shakouri said that the database was created as a resource for advocates to identify what fake clinics were in their area, as well as a resource for organizations such as chatlines to help direct people seeking abortion care. She noted that it was started when many members of the reproductive justice movement began seeing an increasing number of people, even those within their line of work, being confused by crisis pregnancy center or mistaking them for abortion providers. “We were seeing people we work with saying ÔHey, there’s this place in my community that I don’t think it’s an abortion clinic. There’s no one I know works there, but they’re really making themselves look like an abortion clinic. They’re called choices. They’re called women’s health, whatever, whatever,’ and these are people who are well versed in this worked,” said Shakouri. Across the country, CPCs significantly outnumber abortion providers, with roughly 2,600 CPCs to just 428 abortion providers, based on data from the National Abortion Federation. In trigger law states, their presence poses a heightened risk. # Trigger Laws Trigger laws are laws created by states that are presently unenforceable but will be swiftly enacted to ban or severely restrict abortion should Roe v Wade be overturned or significantly undermined. There are currently 13 states with trigger laws: Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. While only these 13 states have trigger laws, as many as 26 states are likely to ban or severely restrict abortion should Roe be overturned, through Pre-Roe bans - bans enacted before 1973 that were blocked by Roe v Wade - amendments to state constitutions offering no protections for the right to abortion, and post-Roe bans signaling the intent to restrict abortion to the maximum extent permitted. 16 states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting the right to abortion. # Roe v Wade and Abortion Rights in the Supreme Court Roe v Wade was a landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that has fundamentally shaped the state of abortion access in the United States. The decision handed down by the Court made access to abortion a constitutional right. In the nearly 50 years since the decision, Roe has faced numerous challenges and is still considered one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases in history. Today, Roe is facing what is potentially its most serious threat, and with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, it is now more likely than ever that it could be overturned. On December 10, 2021, the Supreme Court decided not to block a Texas Senate Bill (S.B. 8) that banned abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy - which is before most women even know they are pregnant. Roe established the right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability - which is usually around 24 weeks - however the Texas law has gotten around this by not criminalizing an abortion occurring after the sixth week, but instead deputizing private citizens to sue anyone suspected of having or assisting someone in having an abortion. Plaintiffs who are successful receive a minimum of $10,000, essentially making them abortion bounty hunters. Texas’ law is the most restrictive in the country, and several states have signaled intent to enact legislation using the same model. Across the country, more and more states are preparing for Roe to be overturned, which is expected to be determined by the end of June, when the Supreme Court issues a decision on Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, but with the initial draft opinion by Justice Alito, a decision could come sooner. # Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization is a case before the Supreme Court in which Jackson Women’s Health Organization - the last abortion provider in the state of Mississippi - is asking the court to block a 2018 law banning all abortions in the state after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the law is allowed to stand, it will fundamentally change the right to abortion across the country and essentially overturn Roe, as it will be the first to outright ban abortion prior to viability. With a 6-3 conservative majority, many consider it likely that the Supreme Court will uphold the Mississippi law, making Roe’s viability standard no longer the supreme law of the land. # CPCs in Trigger Law States In the 13 states with trigger laws, CPCs outnumber abortion providers at an average rate of 20 to 1. While CPCs outnumber abortion providers nationwide - there are over 2600 CPCs compared to approximately 428 abortion providers - trigger law states are especially vulnerable to the harms of CPCs and possess some of the highest rates of CPCs per capita. The rate of CPCs to abortion providers varies widely across trigger law states. In Utah, for example, its roughly a 3:1 ratio, but in Missouri, that rate skyrockets to an astonishing 73 CPCs to the one remaining abortion provider in the state. Should Roe be overturned and trigger laws take effect, women seeking abortions in these states will become even more susceptible to the harms that CPCs cause, said Shakouri. Jessica Waters, Dean of Undergraduate Education at American University, Vice Provost for Academic Students Services, and AU Expert on reproductive rights, said that when trigger laws are enacted, CPCs will serve as another potential barrier to women seeking abortions in other states. “There will still be states that are offering abortion, but that means women are going to have to travel, and if a woman is traveling to another state for an abortion and mistakenly goes into a crisis pregnancy center, it’s just prolonging the entire process,” she said. Waters explained that with many states pushing the limit on when one can get an abortion earlier and earlier, even losing a few days can be detrimental to access. “A woman may have taken a day off work right for whatever it was to travel to the clinic, and now she’s a day or two or three days out,” said Waters. “It could have the effect of pushing a woman past the time limit where she can obtain abortion care.” According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy institute committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health, 58% of women of reproductive age in the United States - 40 million women - live in states hostile to abortion rights. Erin Bordman, a graduate student at American University, said that she has grown increasingly anxious about the future of abortion access in her hometown of Kansas City, MO. “Given the fact that it’s already hard enough, and there’s so few places in which women can get access to that sort of care, it’s terrifying to think what could happen,” she said. In 2019, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill that outlaws all abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. If the law is allowed to take effect, it would have dire implications for over 700,000 women in the state. The state’s only remaining abortion provider, a Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, is within walking distance of two CPCs. One of the two CPCs, ThriVe Women’s Health Care, is 0.4 miles away from Planned Parenthood, and actively advertises abortion counseling and “pre-abortion screenings” despite not offering abortions or abortion referrals. Bordman said given the hostile and intimidating scenes she has seen outside of even non-abortion providing Planned Parenthoods in Missouri, she worries that even more women could be driven to nearby CPCs. “There’s always a ton of protesters on any given day, and there’s always women having to be escorted inside so that they don’t get harassed,” she said. “There’s already just so many barriers, especially for less privileged individuals and people of color. If somewhere else looks like they’re offering abortions and there’s no protesters or anyone harassing you, I can definitely see how that would look like the better option.” The risks of CPCs are especially high for women of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, low-income and young women. Members of these groups are less likely to be able to afford out-of-state travel for abortion access, and are more likely to be targeted by and face abuse from CPCs. Of the 20 states with the lowest GDP per capita, seven of them are states with trigger laws. As Shakouri points out, CPCs are more likely to have negative impacts on members of these communities through their false promises. “Fake clinics are trying to put a soft face to the anti-abortion movement and also to position itself as a solution,” she said. “One of the largest critiques that anti-abortion folks get is ÔOkay, if you ban abortion, how are you going to take care of these pregnant people and their subsequent children?’ and we know CPCs exist to talk people out of an abortion, but the support that they promised afterward, including free diapers, parenting classes, all this support, it either doesn’t materialize or it times out or it’s just not sufficient a person carrying an unintended pregnancy to term,” said Shakouri. “One box of diapers is not going to help someone who is facing poverty and doesn’t have childcare solutions, so we know that fake clinics are not a solution to the post-Roe world.”" /> <meta property="og:description" content="On May 2, 2022 Politico announced that the Supreme Court had voted to overturn Roe v Wade, according to an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito.

Should Roe be overturned and trigger laws take effect, women seeking abortions in these states will become even more susceptible to the harms that CPCs cause, said Shakouri. Jessica Waters, Dean of Undergraduate Education at American University, Vice Provost for Academic Students Services, and AU Expert on reproductive rights, said that when trigger laws are enacted, CPCs will serve as another potential barrier to women seeking abortions in other states. “There will still be states that are offering abortion, but that means women are going to have to travel, and if a woman is traveling to another state for an abortion and mistakenly goes into a crisis pregnancy center, it’s just prolonging the entire process,” she said. Waters explained that with many states pushing the limit on when one can get an abortion earlier and earlier, even losing a few days can be detrimental to access. “A woman may have taken a day off work right for whatever it was to travel to the clinic, and now she’s a day or two or three days out,” said Waters. “It could have the effect of pushing a woman past the time limit where she can obtain abortion care.” According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy institute committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health, 58% of women of reproductive age in the United States - 40 million women - live in states hostile to abortion rights. Erin Bordman, a graduate student at American University, said that she has grown increasingly anxious about the future of abortion access in her hometown of Kansas City, MO. “Given the fact that it’s already hard enough, and there’s so few places in which women can get access to that sort of care, it’s terrifying to think what could happen,” she said. In 2019, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill that outlaws all abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. If the law is allowed to take effect, it would have dire implications for over 700,000 women in the state. The state’s only remaining abortion provider, a Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, is within walking distance of two CPCs. One of the two CPCs, ThriVe Women’s Health Care, is 0.4 miles away from Planned Parenthood, and actively advertises abortion counseling and “pre-abortion screenings” despite not offering abortions or abortion referrals. Bordman said given the hostile and intimidating scenes she has seen outside of even non-abortion providing Planned Parenthoods in Missouri, she worries that even more women could be driven to nearby CPCs. “There’s always a ton of protesters on any given day, and there’s always women having to be escorted inside so that they don’t get harassed,” she said. “There’s already just so many barriers, especially for less privileged individuals and people of color. If somewhere else looks like they’re offering abortions and there’s no protesters or anyone harassing you, I can definitely see how that would look like the better option.” The risks of CPCs are especially high for women of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, low-income and young women. Members of these groups are less likely to be able to afford out-of-state travel for abortion access, and are more likely to be targeted by and face abuse from CPCs. Of the 20 states with the lowest GDP per capita, seven of them are states with trigger laws. As Shakouri points out, CPCs are more likely to have negative impacts on members of these communities through their false promises. “Fake clinics are trying to put a soft face to the anti-abortion movement and also to position itself as a solution,” she said. “One of the largest critiques that anti-abortion folks get is ÔOkay, if you ban abortion, how are you going to take care of these pregnant people and their subsequent children?’ and we know CPCs exist to talk people out of an abortion, but the support that they promised afterward, including free diapers, parenting classes, all this support, it either doesn’t materialize or it times out or it’s just not sufficient a person carrying an unintended pregnancy to term,” said Shakouri. “One box of diapers is not going to help someone who is facing poverty and doesn’t have childcare solutions, so we know that fake clinics are not a solution to the post-Roe world.”","@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script> <!-- End Jekyll SEO tag --> <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"> --> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/spring-2022/css/main.css"> <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="COMM-260 Quant Methods & Data Viz (Spring 2022)" href="http://comm-260.github.io/spring-2022/spring-2022/feed.xml"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"> </head> <body> <header class="site-header"> <nav class="navbar navbar-default"> <div class="container-fluid"> <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile display --> <div class="navbar-header"> <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false"> <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span> <span class="icon-bar"></span> <span class="icon-bar"></span> <span class="icon-bar"></span> </button> <a class="navbar-brand" href="/spring-2022/">COMM-260 Quant Methods & Data Viz (Spring 2022)</a> </div> <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for toggling --> <div class="collapse navbar-collapse " id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1"> <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"> <li><a href="/spring-2022/about/">About</a></li> <!--<li><a href="/spring-2022/contact/">Contact</a></li>--> <!--<li class="dropdown"> <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Download <span class="caret"></span></a> <ul class="dropdown-menu"> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sharu725/cards">Project</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/sharu725/cards/archive/master.zip">Download</a></li> <li role="separator" class="divider"></li> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://jekyll-themes.com">More Themes</a></li> </ul> </li>--> </ul> </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse --> </div><!-- /.container-fluid --> </nav> </header> <div class="container"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-8"> <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header class="post-header"> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The threat of crisis pregnancy centers in 'trigger law' states</h1> <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2022-05-04T08:00:00-04:00" itemprop="datePublished">May 4, 2022</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">By Lily Sweeting</span></span></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>On May 2, 2022 <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473">Politico</a> announced that the Supreme Court had voted to overturn <em>Roe v Wade</em>, according to an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito. While this is only a draft, and an official decision has not yet been issued, it is now likelier than ever that women across the country will lose the federal protections to abortion access they have been granted for nearly five decades.</p> <p>The draft indicates that the court will rule in favor of a Mississippi law that will ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi is one of 13 states that have created Ôtrigger laws’, which are laws that will attempt to completely ban or severely restrict abortion in the event that <em>Roe</em> is overturned. In these 13 states, most of which already have <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/a-guide-to-abortion-laws-by-state">restrictive abortion laws</a>, crisis pregnancy centers outnumber abortion providers at an average rate of 20 to one per capita.</p> <p>Crisis pregnancy centers are an important tool of the anti-abortion movement, and pose a serious risk to women nationwide, but are especially harmful in states hostile to abortion, such as those with trigger laws. Should the draft be adopted by the Supreme Court and <em>Roe</em> be overturned, crisis pregnancy centers will further exacerbate the many obstacles faced by women seeking abortions.</p> <h1 id="-crisis-pregnancy-centers-cpcs"># Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs)</h1> <p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/blog/what-are-crisis-pregnancy-centers">Crisis pregnancy centers</a> are clinics (or in many cases, mobile vans) that advertise a wide variety of services to pregnant women, such as free pregnancy tests, baby supplies and parenting classes. CPCs are one of the most powerful tools used by the anti-abortion movement. The vast majority of CPCs are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6318184/">religiously affiliated</a> and critics argue that their goal is preventing women from seeking and obtaining abortions.</p> <p>In pursuit of this goal, there are many <a href="https://prochoicemd.medium.com/manipulation-lies-and-crisis-pregnancy-centers-f9a95e25113b">tactics</a> employed by CPCs to get “abortion-vulnerable” women - those likely to seek an abortion - through their doors. These include the promise of services and supplies once the woman gives birth, religious propaganda, a lack of transparency on websites and over the phone about the services provided at clinics, and harmful misinformation about abortion.</p> <p>In recent years, CPCs have moved to further their legitimacy by giving the impression of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21146011/crisis-pregnancy-center-resource-abortion-title-x">licensed medical facilities</a> staffed by medical professionals, when in most cases, they are not, said Shireen Rose Shakouri, deputy director of <a href="https://reproaction.org/">Reproaction</a>, an organization with the mission of increasing abortion access and advancing reproductive justice. Civilian volunteers with no medical training will often wear white coats in exam rooms with women, and many will even perform ultrasounds with no medical purpose as a manipulative persuasion tool.</p> <p>“A big tactic of the anti-abortion movement is deception, because it has to be, or they would not survive and function. The world they are fighting for is incredibly unpopular,” said Shakouri.</p> <p>Many CPCs will <a href="https://www.legalvoice.org/know-before-you-go">position themselves</a> nearby or directly next to clinics like Planned Parenthood or other known abortion providers and advertise themselves as providing similar services to these clinics. The purpose of these tactics being to <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-crisis-pregnancy-centers-are-legal-unethical/2018-03">mislead</a> women seeking an abortion and hopefully have them walk through the wrong door.</p> <p>According to Shakouri, once inside, CPC employees provide patients with misinformation about abortion to instill fear of the procedure in women who come in seeking one. Some of the most common <a href="https://prochoicenc.org/common-fake-womens-health-center-misinformation/">falsehoods</a> about abortions spread by CPCs are that they cause breast cancer, prevent women from getting pregnant again, that surgical abortions are extremely risky surgeries, and that they lead to serious psychological damage or Ô<a href="https://scholars.org/brief/why-false-claims-about-nonexistent-post-abortion-syndrome-influence-access-abortion-america">post-abortion syndrome</a>’.</p> <p>Informing women of the dangers of CPCs is an important part of Reproaction’s work, said Shakouri. The organization is home to the <a href="https://reproaction.org/fakeclinicdatabase/">Fake Clinic Database</a>, which is a database detailing every known crisis pregnancy center or fake abortion clinic in the country. The name and address are listed for each clinic, as well as a link to their website, and if they have a known affiliation with one of the larger anti-abortion umbrella organizations like <a href="https://www.care-net.org/">Care Net</a> or <a href="https://www.heartbeatservices.org/services-home">Heartbeat International</a>.</p> <p>Shakouri said that the database was created as a resource for advocates to identify what fake clinics were in their area, as well as a resource for organizations such as chatlines to help direct people seeking abortion care. She noted that it was started when many members of the reproductive justice movement began seeing an increasing number of people, even those within their line of work, being confused by crisis pregnancy center or mistaking them for abortion providers.</p> <p>“We were seeing people we work with saying ÔHey, there’s this place in my community that I don’t think it’s an abortion clinic. There’s no one I know works there, but they’re really making themselves look like an abortion clinic. They’re called choices. They’re called women’s health, whatever, whatever,’ and these are people who are well versed in this worked,” said Shakouri.</p> <iframe title="CPCs per 1 Million Residents" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-CBYHX" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CBYHX/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="501"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Across the country, CPCs significantly outnumber abortion providers, with roughly 2,600 CPCs to just 428 abortion providers, based on data from the <a href="https://prochoice.org/">National Abortion Federation</a>.

The decision handed down by the Court made access to abortion a constitutional right. In the nearly 50 years since the decision, <em>Roe</em> has faced numerous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/30/abortion-rulings-history-roe-v-wade">challenges</a> and is still considered one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases in history.</p> <p>Today, <em>Roe</em> is facing what is potentially its most serious threat, and with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, it is now more likely than ever that it could be overturned.</p> <p>On December 10, 2021, the Supreme Court decided not to block a <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/03/senate-bill-8-texas-abortion-ban-remains-enforced-supreme-court/">Texas Senate Bill (S.B. 8)</a> that banned abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy - which is before most women even know they are pregnant. <em>Roe</em> established the right to abortion up to the point of <a href="https://www.insider.com/fetal-viability">fetal viability</a> - which is usually around 24 weeks - however the Texas law has gotten around this by not criminalizing an abortion occurring after the sixth week, but instead <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/abortion-law-texas.html">deputizing private citizens</a> to sue anyone suspected of having or assisting someone in having an abortion. Plaintiffs who are successful receive a minimum of $10,000, essentially making them abortion bounty hunters.
