One of the main areas that created a lot of tension for many Americans was the issue of paying rent. At a time when money was scarce, it seemed like landlords were raising rental prices around the country. Looking back at this issue can provide us with some insights into why this happened and what caused the problem. The pandemic was a universal struggle for almost all Americans. One of the main areas that created a lot of tension for many Americans was the issue of paying rent. At a time when money was scarce, it seemed like landlords were raising rental prices around the country. Looking back at this issue can provide us with some insights into why this happened and what caused the problem. ​On average, during the first year of the pandemic, rent rose for 1 bedroom apartments in major US cities by an average of 19.36%, while, on average, populations stayed relatively the same and unemployment skyrocketed. ​“Because of the pandemic, a lot of property managers, landlords, investors, sold their investment properties,” says Joe Lonabaugh, a realtor from Keller Williams Realty out of Philadelphia, “This means that there are no places to go, which ended up raising the rental prices.” Essentially, investors and property managers, due to uncertainty in the market caused by the pandemic, altered the supply and demand of the rental market. By selling their properties they greatly decreased the rental supply, all while the demand stayed the same or even went up in some places. This provides part of the solution we need to figure out why rent was increasing at a time when it seemingly should have fallen. Outliers However, during the first year of the pandemic, some cities did not follow this trend of rent increase; on the contrary, rent fell by a fair amount in these particular places. Major population centers, such as San Francisco, Boston, and New York, all saw their rent decrease by almost 20 percent or more. The chart shows a clear correlation, excluding the one outlier of San Jose, between rent prices and population. In San Francisco, there was a loss of population by about one and a half percent, which then led to rent shrinking by about 24%. This would make sense, as fewer people lead to less demand, which will lower the overall market. I reached out to Carla Cierra, a real estate agent based in New York City, one of the cities that saw a loss in population, to talk about this subject. “In New York City, where we work, there was a max exodus of people, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, as people moved to where there was more outdoor space,” Cierra said, “vacancy rates shot up and prices came down considerably”. Cierra is explaining exactly what the data shows - as people are leaving these major population centers, the supply of rentals is rising, lowering prices. “There was a decrease in demand,” says Ken Blagburn of DC Real Property, “people were staying where they were, [with] less transient behavior … prices definitely took a hit, rental market took a hit”. Blagburn provides a similar story to Cierra. Less people looking to rent dropping the demand, lowering the overall price. Making the Correlation So, we now know that there seems to be a direct relationship between the population change of a city and the rent prices of apartments, at least in the first year of the pandemic. In order to make sure that this is an actual trend and just the case in one sample time period, we need to dig into the data from the next year, 2021-2022. This year, although enduring spikes of coronavirus, was a year of hope - vaccines, people going back to school and work, and a slow start to return to normalcy. As people return to more urban areas we should see that correlation with population and rent prices again. This chart, once again, shows that there is a relationship between population change and rental prices. In almost all the cities on the chart, there is population growth, leading to the rise in rental prices. In Miami, there was a population growth of over 1%, which resulted in an average rent increase of about 58%. Both Lonabaughm and Cierra agree with this trend. “Towards the ‘end’ of the pandemic, there were far more people looking to rent than there previously were. That’s still going on today”, says Lonabaughm. “In NYC now prices are higher than before,” Cierra replied, “The rental market is on fire, people are looking towards the city, especially young people.” With the pandemic seemingly reaching the end stages, people are eager to return to cities and resume living their lives. The Last Piece of the Puzzle ​The last piece of the puzzle to discovering the issue of rent during the pandemic, particularly during the first year, is the unemployment rate. We know that in some major cities, such as New York or San Francisco, there was a loss in population, resulting in rent decreases. However, for a majority of places rent rose. So, I wanted to have a look at the unemployment rate to see if that exacerbated the problem of rising rent. This chart shows the unemployment rates over the first year of the pandemic. Throughout America, the unemployment rate rose by an average of 36.47%. This, when combined with the average rise of 19.36% in rent that same year, is definitely a reason why so many Americans faced problems when having to pay their rent that year. In the End The rise in rent, at least in places where rent rose, was caused by less properties being available, due to property managers and investors selling them, causing the supply to shrink, increasing the price. This was exacerbated by the rising unemployment rate in most states, causing people to struggle to pay rent. On the other hand, in cities where the rent lessened, it was caused by a migration of people from the cities to the suburbs, in order to get more space at a time when everyone was stuck at home. The government did their best to provide relief for this, with stimulus packages and other forms of payment to offset living expenses. However, the pandemic was still a troubling time for many Americans, with rent being one of the many factors that created tensions in people’s lives. Hopefully we are able to move on now and leave it behind us." /> <meta property="og:description" content="The pandemic was a universal struggle for almost all Americans.
