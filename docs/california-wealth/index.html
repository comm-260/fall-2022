Up until the management switch that raised his rent to $629, he paid $525 a month using his disability and retirement checks. Now, rent costs take up about 60 percent of the money he receives from these two checks. Even so, management is proposing another rent increase. “They’re trying to raise [my rent] to $1,350,” Dillard said. “I get a retirement check and a disability check. It don’t [sic] add up to no $1,350. They’re making it to where I can’t buy toiletries and stuff like that.” As of 2019 (the most recent data available), Black and Latino-headed houses are 69 and 32 percent, respectively, more likely to spend exorbitant amounts — over half their income — on housing costs than white households are. This data comes from Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and is found using a metric called housing cost burden, which is calculated by dividing housing costs by monthly income. According to Michael Tanner, a poverty researcher at the Cato Institute, these two factors work in tandem with one another to create California’s housing crisis, the worst in the nation. “The two interact together,” Tanner said. “You have extremely high housing costs and have the fact that communities of color generally have lower incomes. So basically, you’ve got the worst of both worlds going on.” When first looking at housing inequality, it is impossible to separate California’s history of racially-motivated housing policies from its present crisis, Sara Kimberlin, an affiliate at the Stanford Center on Poverty &amp; Equality with a focus on housing, explains. “Within housing policy, there is a history of specifically racist policies that have things like redlining, where households of color were explicitly blocked from entering into homeownership,” Kimberlin said. “That history leaves a strong impression on the patterns that we see now.” As Tanner points out, these policies jump-started the issue of housing inequality but current zoning laws only exacerbate their effects. “For a long time it was very difficult for African Americans and other people of color to buy housing and many areas were Black only, white only,” Tanner said. “So certainly white Californians have benefitted from past racial segregation and those policies are carried on to some degree by zoning. They’re not exclusively racial, but they still block minorities from moving into those communities.” Historical redlining and current zoning practices hinder households of color from homeownership in desirable neighborhoods, leading to inequality on the housing side of housing cost burden. But as Tanner states, California has a level of poverty counter to its extreme wealth and this income disparity further worsens the housing crisis. In fact, California’s lowest income families earn 11 times less than families at the top of the income ladder, according to the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC). “California of course is a state that has vast pockets of wealth, it is a state that has solid economic growth, and it is a state that has an extensive social safety net,” Tanner said. “It is also a state that has the highest poverty rate in the nation and the fourth highest rate of inequality of any state, so clearly there’s a problem.” Linna Zhu, PhD, a Research Associate at the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center, cites income inequality as the biggest cause of racial inequality in housing cost burden. “Everyone experiences the same level of house price and rent depreciation rates,” Zhu said. “Then when we look at the impact of those depreciations, or increase in costs, the impact could be very different depending on the individual level of income, where there’s greater disparity.” And these disparities are not small ones; according to data from the American Community Survey, the median annual income for Black-headed households in 2021 was almost $59,000, 37 percent lower than for their white counterparts. For Latino households, income is a bit higher at $70,000 annually, although still 25 percent less than the white median. One of the biggest factors in racial income inequalities is disparity at the employment level. According to Kimberlin, people of color are disproportionately hired for lower-paying jobs, only furthering the wage gap between racial groups. “Present day and historical patterns of implicit and explicit discrimination have pushed a lot of Black and Latino residents into jobs that pay lower wages and have less job security,” Kimberlin said. “This translates into income inequality, which translates into fewer homeownership opportunities.” Dillard experienced this firsthand. After moving to Sacramento, his new union pushed him into pipe laying instead of plumbing — which he was trained for — which Dillard believes was due to his being Black. “When I came to join this union, since my skin ain’t [sic] the right color, they kept sending me on jobs digging holes,” Dillard said. “I told them, that isn’t what I went to school for. I went to school to be a pipe fitter, they turned me into a plumber. When I was starting, a pipe fitter was making $40 an hour and a plumber was making $32 an hour.” Furthermore, education helps raise students out of poverty and into high paying jobs. With people of color getting less access to higher education, these higher paying jobs are kept out of reach. PPIC research fellow Marisol Cuellar Mejia stresses the role of education in exacerbating racial income inequality lines. “[Income inequality is] the consequence of education attainment,” Cuellar Mejia said. “We have a higher share of white houses where at least one of the heads have a Bachelor’s degree or higher than Latino and Hispanic households.” Core issues of housing opportunity, income, employment and education inequality may have lit the fire for California’s housing crisis, but community pushback on affordable housing initiatives only fuels its flames. Not In My Back Yard (NIMBYism) is a concept where a community supports developmental decisions in theory until they are actually implemented within the community. According to Cuellar Mejia, this movement makes it harder for local governments to increase the housing supply by striking down construction plans for affordable housing, particularly multi-family units. “[NIMBYism] is a big part of the problem because it’s restricting supply and really our problems in terms of affordability and the housing crisis is from the lack of supply,” Cuellar Mejia said. Discussions of NIMBYism conjures up images of the wealthy coastal elite cheersing their champagne glasses after successfully blocking access to affordable housing for families of color. However, as Tanner points out, those proclaiming NIMBYism are often just average people, unwilling to make changes in their community to mitigate the inequality. “The people who are already at the top are going to object,” Tanner said. “And the stereotype is that it’s rich businessmen, but it’s not always rich businessmen. It’s powerful groups from union leaders to homeowners to businesses to legislators. It’s basically everyone who’s benefiting from the system today. Powerful people want to preserve the status quo, and it doesn’t break down that easily along liberal-conservative lines either.” Before the pandemic, CHAS data showed that California’s housing discrepancies actually seemed to be improving. For every racial group, the percent of households with high housing cost burdens decreased between 2010 and 2019. But, it appeared the development would be short lived. In March of 2020, only three months after the advancement was measured, California was overtaken by COVID-19, leading to mass layoffs, economic lags, unprecedented medical bills and diluted online education. One thing that remained constant? Rent prices. The pandemic hit households of color especially hard, stalling any progress California had made in mitigating housing inequality, according to Kimberlin. “Job losses during the pandemic were particularly concentrated in occupations and industries that tended to pay lower wages,” Kimberlin said. “Californians of color are more likely to be in these lower-wage jobs so then they’re being hit multiple times. At the same time, the economy was slowing down, but rents didn’t drop in a lot of places so the ongoing challenge of housing affordability hasn’t gone away.” California’s housing crisis is not a victimless issue. As owning a house is one of the basic ways to pass down wealth, disproportionately high housing cost burdens push families of color out of homeownership and generational wealth accumulation. Spending over half of one’s monthly income on housing forces households of color to prioritize housing while other equally important costs have to be ignored, as Kimberlin describes. “If you have unaffordable housing costs, you are usually forced to compromise on other important needs that your family or you as an individual need to address,” Kimberlin said. “You have to pay your rent, but that may mean that you don’t have money to pay for high quality childcare for your children or food at the end of the month. You don’t have enough money to invest in your education or to set aside money for retirement. Failing to meet those other basic needs, there are cascading consequences to that.” California’s housing crisis is a deeply ingrained, institutionalized issue, requiring both short-term and long-term solutions to overcome. Short term, as Zhu recommends, California needs to invest in construction projects to increase housing supply while putting measures in place to make this housing more affordable to families of color. “The first step is to build more properties, build more houses both for homeowners and renters,” Zhu said. “When you increase the supply, that will mitigate the price pressure. Once you have more properties, expanding credit acts especially to households of color so that more of them can afford the new properties on the market.” Once the initial housing shortage is mitigated, Kimberlin advocates for systemic changes in education, childcare, social security and employment to make these institutions more equitable. “It’s one of those things where there is no silver bullet answer to how to address it,” Kimberlin said. “What needs to happen is just action across a lot of different areas: addressing jobs, safety nets, housing supply, childcare supply. Progress across a lot of different domains is important to make sure that we can be moving in the right direction.” Until those measures are put in place, Tanner believes the average California citizen can vote or put pressure on their local governments to enact change. After all, some renters already are — Dillard being one of them. “Some old people will give up the money so they don’t have a problem,” Dillard said. “They’re scared they’re gonna get kicked out. But if they kick me out, it’s gonna be all over the news. I’ll be ready to burn this fucker down.”" /> <meta property="og:description" content="Eight years ago, Shelly Dillard moved into Continental Terrace Apartments in Sacramento after separating from his wife.

I’ll be ready to burn this fucker down.”","@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script> <!-- End Jekyll SEO tag --> <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"> --> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/fall-2022/css/main.css"> <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="COMM-260 Quant Methods & Data Viz (Fall 2022)" href="http://comm-260.github.io/fall-2022/fall-2022/feed.xml"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"> </head> <body> <header class="site-header"> <nav class="navbar navbar-default"> <div class="container-fluid"> <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile display --> <div class="navbar-header"> <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false"> <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span> <span class="icon-bar"></span> <span class="icon-bar"></span> <span class="icon-bar"></span> </button> <a class="navbar-brand" href="/fall-2022/">COMM-260 Quant Methods & Data Viz (Fall 2022)</a> </div> <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for toggling --> <div class="collapse navbar-collapse " id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1"> <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"> <li><a href="/fall-2022/about/">About</a></li> <!--<li><a href="/fall-2022/contact/">Contact</a></li>--> <!--<li class="dropdown"> <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Download <span class="caret"></span></a> <ul class="dropdown-menu"> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sharu725/cards">Project</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/sharu725/cards/archive/master.zip">Download</a></li> <li role="separator" class="divider"></li> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://jekyll-themes.com">More Themes</a></li> </ul> </li>--> </ul> </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse --> </div><!-- /.container-fluid --> </nav> </header> <div class="container"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-8"> <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header class="post-header"> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">California's wealth hides a housing crisis</h1> <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2022-12-14T11:39:00-05:00" itemprop="datePublished">Dec 14, 2022</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">By Martha Fishburne</span></span></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>Eight years ago, Shelly Dillard moved into Continental Terrace Apartments in Sacramento after separating from his wife. Up until the management switch that raised his rent to $629, he paid $525 a month using his disability and retirement checks.</p> <p>Now, rent costs take up about 60 percent of the money he receives from these two checks. Even so, management is proposing another rent increase.</p> <p>“They’re trying to raise [my rent] to $1,350,” Dillard said. “I get a retirement check and a disability check. It don’t [sic] add up to no $1,350. They’re making it to where I can’t buy toiletries and stuff like that.”</p> <p>As of <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp.html#2006-2019_data">2019</a> (the most recent data available), Black and Latino-headed houses are 69 and 32 percent, respectively, more likely to spend exorbitant amounts — over half their income — on housing costs than white households are.</p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12099370"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>This data comes from Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and is found using a metric called housing cost burden, which is calculated by dividing housing costs by monthly income. According to Michael Tanner, a poverty researcher at the Cato Institute, these two factors work in tandem with one another to create California’s housing crisis, the worst in the nation.</p> <p>“The two interact together,” Tanner said. “You have extremely high housing costs and have the fact that communities of color generally have lower incomes. So basically, you’ve got the worst of both worlds going on.”</p> <p>When first looking at housing inequality, it is impossible to separate California’s history of racially-motivated housing policies from its present crisis, Sara Kimberlin, an affiliate at the Stanford Center on Poverty &amp; Equality with a focus on housing, explains.</p> <p>“Within housing policy, there is a history of specifically racist policies that have things like redlining, where households of color were explicitly blocked from entering into homeownership,” Kimberlin said. “That history leaves a strong impression on the patterns that we see now.”</p> <p>As Tanner points out, these policies jump-started the issue of housing inequality but current zoning laws only exacerbate their effects.</p> <p>“For a long time it was very difficult for African Americans and other people of color to buy housing and many areas were Black only, white only,” Tanner said. “So certainly white Californians have benefitted from past racial segregation and those policies are carried on to some degree by zoning. They’re not exclusively racial, but they still block minorities from moving into those communities.”</p> <p>Historical redlining and current zoning practices hinder households of color from homeownership in desirable neighborhoods, leading to inequality on the housing side of housing cost burden. But as Tanner states, California has a level of poverty counter to its extreme wealth and this income disparity further worsens the housing crisis. In fact, California’s lowest income families earn <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/income-inequality-in-california/#:~:text=Income%20inequality%20is%20a%20major%20concern%20in%20California.&amp;text=Families%20at%20the%20top%20of,and%2010th%20percentiles%2C%20respectively">11 times</a> less than families at the top of the income ladder, according to the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC).</p> <p>“California of course is a state that has vast pockets of wealth, it is a state that has solid economic growth, and it is a state that has an extensive social safety net,” Tanner said. “It is also a state that has the highest poverty rate in the nation and the fourth highest rate of inequality of any state, so clearly there’s a problem.”</p> <p>Linna Zhu, PhD, a Research Associate at the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center, cites income inequality as the biggest cause of racial inequality in housing cost burden.</p> <p>“Everyone experiences the same level of house price and rent depreciation rates,” Zhu said. “Then when we look at the impact of those depreciations, or increase in costs, the impact could be very different depending on the individual level of income, where there’s greater disparity.”</p> <p>And these disparities are not small ones; according to data from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=median+household+income&amp;t=Hispanic+or+Latino&amp;g=0400000US06&amp;y=2021&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2021.S1903">American Community Survey</a>, the median annual income for Black-headed households in 2021 was almost $59,000, 37 percent lower than for their white counterparts. For Latino households, income is a bit higher at $70,000 annually, although still 25 percent less than the white median.</p> <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/12099674"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>One of the biggest factors in racial income inequalities is disparity at the employment level. According to Kimberlin, people of color are disproportionately hired for lower-paying jobs, only furthering the wage gap between racial groups.</p> <p>“Present day and historical patterns of implicit and explicit discrimination have pushed a lot of Black and Latino residents into jobs that pay lower wages and have less job security,” Kimberlin said. “This translates into income inequality, which translates into fewer homeownership opportunities.”</p> <p>Dillard experienced this firsthand. After moving to Sacramento, his new union pushed him into pipe laying instead of plumbing — which he was trained for — which Dillard believes was due to his being Black.</p> <p>“When I came to join this union, since my skin ain’t [sic] the right color, they kept sending me on jobs digging holes,” Dillard said. “I told them, that isn’t what I went to school for. I went to school to be a pipe fitter, they turned me into a plumber. When I was starting, a pipe fitter was making $40 an hour and a plumber was making $32 an hour.”</p> <p>Furthermore, education helps raise students out of poverty and into high paying jobs. With people of color getting less access to higher education, these higher paying jobs are kept out of reach. PPIC research fellow Marisol Cuellar Mejia stresses the role of education in exacerbating racial income inequality lines.</p> <p>“[Income inequality is] the consequence of education attainment,” Cuellar Mejia said. “We have a higher share of white houses where at least one of the heads have a Bachelor’s degree or higher than Latino and Hispanic households.”</p> <p>Core issues of housing opportunity, income, employment and education inequality may have lit the fire for California’s housing crisis, but community pushback on affordable housing initiatives only fuels its flames. Not In My Back Yard (NIMBYism) is a concept where a community supports developmental decisions in theory until they are actually implemented within the community.</p> <p>According to Cuellar Mejia, this movement makes it harder for local governments to increase the housing supply by striking down construction plans for affordable housing, particularly multi-family units.</p> <p>“[NIMBYism] is a big part of the problem because it’s restricting supply and really our problems in terms of affordability and the housing crisis is from the lack of supply,” Cuellar Mejia said.</p> <p>Discussions of NIMBYism conjures up images of the wealthy coastal elite cheersing their champagne glasses after successfully blocking access to affordable housing for families of color. However, as Tanner points out, those proclaiming NIMBYism are often just average people, unwilling to make changes in their community to mitigate the inequality.</p> <p>“The people who are already at the top are going to object,” Tanner said. “And the stereotype is that it’s rich businessmen, but it’s not always rich businessmen. It’s powerful groups from union leaders to homeowners to businesses to legislators. It’s basically everyone who’s benefiting from the system today. Powerful people want to preserve the status quo, and it doesn’t break down that easily along liberal-conservative lines either.”</p> <p>Before the pandemic, CHAS data showed that California’s housing discrepancies actually seemed to be improving. For every racial group, the percent of households with high housing cost burdens decreased between 2010 and 2019.</p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12099847"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>But, it appeared the development would be short lived. In March of 2020, only three months after the advancement was measured, California was overtaken by COVID-19, leading to mass layoffs, economic lags, unprecedented medical bills and diluted online education.</p> <p>One thing that remained constant? Rent prices.</p> <p>The pandemic hit households of color especially hard, stalling any progress California had made in mitigating housing inequality, according to Kimberlin.</p> <p>“Job losses during the pandemic were particularly concentrated in occupations and industries that tended to pay lower wages,” Kimberlin said. “Californians of color are more likely to be in these lower-wage jobs so then they’re being hit multiple times. At the same time, the economy was slowing down, but rents didn’t drop in a lot of places so the ongoing challenge of housing affordability hasn’t gone away.”</p> <p>California’s housing crisis is not a victimless issue. As owning a house is one of the basic ways to pass down wealth, disproportionately high housing cost burdens push families of color out of homeownership and generational wealth accumulation. Spending over half of one’s monthly income on housing forces households of color to prioritize housing while other equally important costs have to be ignored, as Kimberlin describes.</p> <p>“If you have unaffordable housing costs, you are usually forced to compromise on other important needs that your family or you as an individual need to address,” Kimberlin said. “You have to pay your rent, but that may mean that you don’t have money to pay for high quality childcare for your children or food at the end of the month. You don’t have enough money to invest in your education or to set aside money for retirement. Failing to meet those other basic needs, there are cascading consequences to that.”</p> <p>California’s housing crisis is a deeply ingrained, institutionalized issue, requiring both short-term and long-term solutions to overcome. Short term, as Zhu recommends, California needs to invest in construction projects to increase housing supply while putting measures in place to make this housing more affordable to families of color.</p> <p>“The first step is to build more properties, build more houses both for homeowners and renters,” Zhu said. “When you increase the supply, that will mitigate the price pressure. Once you have more properties, expanding credit acts especially to households of color so that more of them can afford the new properties on the market.”</p> <p>Once the initial housing shortage is mitigated, Kimberlin advocates for systemic changes in education, childcare, social security and employment to make these institutions more equitable.</p> <p>“It’s one of those things where there is no silver bullet answer to how to address it,” Kimberlin said. “What needs to happen is just action across a lot of different areas: addressing jobs, safety nets, housing supply, childcare supply. Progress across a lot of different domains is important to make sure that we can be moving in the right direction.”</p> <p>Until those measures are put in place, Tanner believes the average California citizen can vote or put pressure on their local governments to enact change. After all, some renters already are — Dillard being one of them.</p> <p>“Some old people will give up the money so they don’t have a problem,” Dillard said. “They’re scared they’re gonna get kicked out. But if they kick me out, it’s gonna be all over the news. I’ll be ready to burn this fucker down.”</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2022/nyc-crimes/">&laquo; Increased Crime In New York City Is 'Nothing New'</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2022/wage-gap/">Wage Gap Runs Rampant in the Garden State &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2022/images/wealth.png" alt="California's wealth hides a housing crisis"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2022/nyc-crimes/">Increased Crime In New York City Is 'Nothing New'</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2022/wage-gap/">Wage Gap Runs Rampant in the Garden State</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2022/young-voters/">Gen-Z and the Midterms</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2022</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2022/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
