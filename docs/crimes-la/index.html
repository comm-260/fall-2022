Protests arose, walk-outs ensued, and people everywhere wanted reparations for those who were killed by police. Los Angeles County was one of the major hubs for protests during the Black Lives Matter Movement. There were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Los_Angeles_County,_California">50 protests</a> in Los Angeles County in response to the death of George Floyd, where the people of Los Angeles County demanded justice for those in their community who were killed by Los Angeles County Police. Police were expected to do better, to ensure the citizens of Los Angeles their safety from police brutality.</p> <p>Officer <a href="https://www.lapdonline.org/command-staff/moore-michel/">Michael Moore</a>, The Chief of Police for the Los Angeles Police Department, declinded to comment on what the Los Angeles Police Department is doing to hold their department accountable for their fatal police shootings.</p> <p>Although seemingly little action has been taken by the Los Angeles Police Department to stop the unjust killings of civilians, the people of Los Angeles County demand accountability. It is unclear when there will be a tangible change within policing, but in the meantime it is important that justice is served.</p> <p>Police killings in Los Angeles County have become more common overtime, causing a lasting impact on the lives of victim’s families. As more people are killed by police in Los Angeles County, there is more grief and uncertainty in neighborhoods that fall victim to police brutality more often than not.</p> <p>In Los Angeles County’s poorest neighborhood, Downtown, the majority of the victims of police homicide are of color. People of color fall victim to police brutality and police homicide disproportionately to white people due to systemic racism. On March 1, 2015 Charly Leundeu Keunang (43) was shot multiple times by police on the 500 block of San Pedro Street in the <a href="https://urm.org/about/faqs/about-skid-row/">skid row section</a> of downtown Los Angeles. He was ordered by police to come out of his tent in Skid Row after fighting with someone inside the tent. A caller to 911 reported that a robbery had occurred in the area. The caller told the arriving officers that Keunang had also threatened them with a baseball bat. The officers stated that Keunang became aggressive and ignored commands. After he refused the police order, he went inside his tent and officers pulled the tent open and a physical altercation ensued with several police officers, during which three officers shot Keunang, resulting in his death. According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/03/06/391140790/coroner-identifies-homeless-man-on-skid-row-killed-by-lapd">National Public Radio (NPR)</a>, police claimed Keunang had gotten hold of one of the officers’ guns during the struggle.</p> <p>The shooting gained national attention when questions were raised over the police officers’ use of force on Keunang. Downtown Los Angeles, where Keunang lived as one of the many unhoused individuals in that area, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/03/02/390245000/l-a-s-skid-row-tense-after-fatal-police-shooting-of-homeless-man">is home to thousands of people with mental illnesses and substance abuse problems</a>. Keunang suffered from both mental illness and substance abuse problems, and at the time of his death he had <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/la-me-ln-skid-row-shooting-autopsy-20150729-story.html">methamphetamine in his system</a> according to an autopsy report. Two witnesses identified Keunang, and the videos on their cellphones raised questions towards the use of unnecessary force by police officers. The family of Keunang later sued LAPD for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/08/23/641074093/city-of-la-approves-1-9-million-settlement-to-family-of-homeless-man-killed-by-l">$1.9 million for use of unnecessary force</a>.</p> <iframe title="Downtown Los Angeles Unhoused Population Health &amp;amp; Disability Report" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-zX7FS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zX7FS/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="240" data-external="1"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Black men like Keuang, are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/policy-steps-for-racially-equitable-policing/">3 times more likely</a> to be killed by police. Systemic racism plays a unique role in who police systems target. People of color are systematically less prosperous than white people, giving them less social mobility. This forces them to remain in lower-income areas, where there is more poverty, crime, and policing.</p> <p>Keuang’s family declined to comment on the injustice against Charly, but are happy that a settlement was reached, but it cannot make up for the injust death of Keuang.</p> <p>“Black teenagers are 21 times more likely than White teenagers to be killed by police: Tamir Rice and Antwon Rose” says Dr. Ray, A Black person is killed every 40 hours by police: Jonathan Ferrell and Koryn Gaines. One in every 1,000 Black people are killed by police: Breonna Taylor” he continues, “And, as sobering as these statistics are, they are improvements to the past. These statistics are the reason why from Minneapolis to Los Angeles people are protesting, marching, and rioting.”</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2022/broadband/">&laquo; Broadband Internet Availability and Low Voter Turnout Across the United States</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2022/mass-shootings/">Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz sentencing perpetuates dangerous media rhetoric about mental illness &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2022/images/LAProtest.jpg" alt="There have been 30x more fatal police shootings in Los Angeles' five poorest neighborhoods than its five richest neighborhoods"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2022/nyc-crimes/">Increased Crime In New York City Is 'Nothing New'</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2022/california-wealth/">California's wealth hides a housing crisis</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2022/wage-gap/">Wage Gap Runs Rampant in the Garden State</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2022</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2022/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
