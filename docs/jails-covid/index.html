</script> <p>Since March 2020, researchers at UCLA Law have collected Covid-19 data from over 1,800 correctional facilities across the U.S., tracking information like cases, deaths, testing and vaccination rates, for both incarcerated people and correctional staff.</p> <p>Their job is often made difficult, however, when facilities are inconsistent in releasing this data. Last month, only 62% of facilities released data on Covid-19 cases among residents, which is the lowest level of reporting since May 2020. In September 2021, the percentage of facilities that reported Covid-19 case data stood at 69%, and the number has steadily decreased each month since then.</p> <p>With <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-health-houston-texas-e46d8b2ef2a68a41c629d2c8a0f4537b">BA.2 becoming the dominant variant</a> in the U.S., researchers worry that correctional facilities will not ensure data transparency despite an increase in cases.</p> <p>“It’s quite concerning, I think, that for this surge, we’ll know less than ever,” said Joshua Manson, communications manager for the UCLA Law project. “For as little information as we had during the last Omicron surge, it’s very astounding that we’ll know less now.”</p> <p>There are a variety of reasons correctional facilities might stop releasing Covid-19 Data, according to Manson. Less public pressure to do so, lack of resources and little to no transparency requirements all could have played a role in the recent decrease in reporting.</p> <p>“They [prisons and jails] have had two years to figure this out. And Covid is obviously not going away, people are still getting sick. To me, now, there’s no excuseÉ” Manson said. “The amount of transparency and data reporting should only be increasing over time, not decreasing.”</p> <p>Matthew Collinson, adjunct instructor in the Department of Justice, Law, and Criminology at American University, pointed to pressure from corrections unions.</p> <p>“Police officers and correctional officers have some of the lowest vaccination rates, so I think there is some pressure from corrections unions and correctional staff not to report Covid-19 data because it reflects poorly on the fact that they are probably a significant vector of Covid at this point,” Collinson said.</p> <iframe title="Percentage of Correctional Facilities Releasing Covid-19 Case Data in March 2022, By State" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-xJsJm" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xJsJm/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="506"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>The analysis revealed that reporting levels vary significantly depending on the location and jurisdiction of the facility. For example, last month, 98% of facilities in Illinois released case data, compared to 78% in Maine, 50% in Texas and 10% in Tennessee.</p> <p>Some states have consistently produced a low percentage of facilities reporting, while others have had a somewhat sudden drop. For example, the percentage of Florida facilities reporting cases fell from 92% to 23% in January 2021, and has remained around 23% ever since. Similarly, Georgia facilities fell from 97% to 29% in August 2021.</p> <iframe title="Percentage of Correctional Facilities in Florida and Georgia Releasing Covid-19 Case Data Over Time" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-p2VX3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/p2VX3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>This could be due to the realization that data reporting is what Manson called a “double-bind” for correctional facilities: while transparency is good, the public can hold the data against officials like politicians.</p> <p>For correctional facilities, “it’s better to just stop reporting than to report the reality, which is bad,” said Manson.</p> <iframe title="6-Month Comparison of Percentage of Correctional Facilities Releasing Covid-19 Case Data, By Jurisdiction" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Z0Th6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z0Th6/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="413"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Not only is there variation across states, but also across the different jurisdictions of correctional facilities. The UCLA project examined facilities under federal, state, county and immigration control. Last month, just 14% of county-level facilities released Covid-19 case data, compared to 92% of immigration facilities.</p> <p>County-level facilities held around 549,000 people as of late 2020, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Despite this, the UCLA Law Covid Behind Bars team has seen much less data reporting from county jails.</p> <p>“When we say that 600,000 people have had Covid behind bars, it’s excluding a huge number of people who are in [county] jails,” Manson said, in reference to the statistics on the UCLA project’s <a href="https://uclacovidbehindbars.org">homepage</a> about cumulative cases.</p> <p>Of the 65 county-level facilities who have released any Covid-19 case data since March 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is around 42,000.</p> <p>Lack of reporting from jails is concerning because since jails typically hold residents short-term, Covid-19 spread is more likely to impact the surrounding community, Collinson said.</p> <p>“The other problem with jails is that they’re not set up to support people long term, so things like medical care tend to be of lower quality than places like prisons because folks don’t expect to stay there,” Collinson said. “ A lot of jail medical positions are not filled and even if they are, they have high turnover… So even for folks who are identified as having Covid-19 in jail, the treatment may not be great.”</p> <p>Collinson also pointed out that jail populations are particularly vulnerable compared to those with longer sentences in prisons.</p> <p>“A lot of folks are in jail because they can’t afford bail,” Collinson said. “So you pile on the risks of poverty with healthcare and how you’re more likely to have preexisting conditions, a potential substance abuse disorder or mental illnessÉ you create this perfect storm of ill health for folks.”</p> <iframe title="Number of Correctional Facilities Releasing Various Categories of Covid Data Reporting" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3JUkH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3JUkH/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Not only has data on cases decreased, but also the other data that the UCLA Law Covid Project collects. Data on deaths, vaccinations and testing have also followed a negative trend in recent months.</p> <p>Data transparency in correctional facilities hasn’t ever been the norm, according to Manson, and the decrease in Covid data reporting in recent months is essentially a return back to “normal.”</p> <p>“This type of Covid reporting was, as small and as insufficient as it is in some places, actually a big deal in the prison transparency world,” Manson said. “This is not something that jails and prisons are used to doing. There’s not really a data collection and reporting infrastructure generally.”</p> <p>However, a return to normal isn’t necessarily a good thing in this case. Data on Covid-19 in prisons matters to a variety of stakeholders.</p> <p>Ellie Fitzgerald’s cousin was incarcerated at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago for three months in early 2021. She expressed frustration with the lack of information that the federal prison system released about Covid-19 in this particular facility.</p> <p>“This was a time before vaccines were rolled out, so it was extremely stressful going about day to day life knowing how hard the pandemic was impacting prisons, but being completely in the dark about cases, testing and deaths in his [Ellie’s cousin] jail,” Fitzgerald said. “My family and I were worried about him constantly, and it would have been comforting to at least know basic information about how bad the situation was there.”</p> <p>The lack of data reporting affects not only family members of incarcerated people, but many other groups as well.</p> <p>“The data matters for epidemiological and public health researchers. It also matters for politicians and lawmakers who are making decisions about how to populate jails and prisons,” Manson said. “It’s a problem for family members who have people incarcerated inside because you want to know how dangerous the jail or prison is where your loved one is being held right nowÉ It matters for judges, public defenders and lawyers, who file different types of emergency lawsuits to get clients out of jail and prison.”</p> <p>Based on how prison communities have interacted with various epidemics and diseases in the past, Manson says that the decrease in data is discouraging.</p> <p>“It’s a troubling trend because as we’ve seen with previous epidemics and previous illnesses, when spread is slowed down in the community, it doesn’t always hold in prisons,” Manson said. “Tuberculosis, HIV and Hepatitis are still prevalent in prisons and jailsÉ That’s likely to happen with Covid too. So, this decrease in transparency, to me, tells me that if the trend holds, in a year’s time, there won’t be any data reported on Covid even though Covid will probably still be there.”</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/spring-2022/rats-nyc/">&laquo; Rats on the rise in NYC</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/spring-2022/homeless-youth/">The Invisible Youths: Unaccompanied Homeless youth in DC &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/spring-2022/images/jails.png" alt="Jails and prisons no longer providing transparent Covid-19 data, despite new variant and recent surge"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/spring-2022/farmers-markets/">The Lack of Farmers Markets in New York’s Black Neighborhoods</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;04 May 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/spring-2022/yellowstone-traffic/">Road construction projects to cause major travel delays in Yellowstone National Park</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;04 May 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/spring-2022/rent-pandemic/">The Pandemic’s Rent Problem: a Retrospective</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;04 May 2022</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/spring-2022/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
