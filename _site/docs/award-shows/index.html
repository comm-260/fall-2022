It was the day after music legend Whitney Houston died suddenly at 48 — and the night of the 54th Grammy Awards. “Viewership went through the roof. Everybody wanted to tune in and see what was going to happen,” said Simson, former president of the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Grammy organization. That telecast turned out to attract almost 40 million viewers — about 10 million more than the next-highest year in viewership since the turn of the millennium. But this was an exception to the rule, not a trendsetter; in the decade since that show aired, Grammys viewership has steadily declined — and award shows in other sects of the entertainment industry have experienced the same thing. Although the four biggest award shows — the Emmys for television, Grammys for music, Oscars or Academy Awards for film and Tonys for theatre — each have differently sized followings (the Oscars being the biggest for pop culture and the Tonys being the most niche), the trends are the same. Even without the considering how the pandemic changed things, all of these shows are down in viewership compared to where they were 20 years ago: Even the Grammys, the show with the least percent change, was almost 30% lower in 2019 (the last year all four shows occurred “normally” pre-COVID) than at the turn of the century. Although the Grammys’ viewership appears the least threatened up to that time, they are still worth looking at as a sort of case study. Their numbers seem to be stuck in a rut: most years in the past two decades had viewership in the 20-millions, while some years would occasionally dip into the 10-millions. Until recently, those dips never lasted more than a couple years in a row; now, Grammys viewership has been below 20 million for several years in a row. ##Why does this matter? Love them, hate them, or just indifferent toward them, awards show are a huge part of pop culture, as well as a major factor in the career of any entertainer. There’s also the material impact these awards consistently have on their respective industries. Take the Grammys for example — part giving out awards to recipients, of course, but also largely a concert of some of the year’s biggest acts. One more reason the decline in viewership is important is that these shows and the awards they dole out are a product and a marker of power. The Grammy Awards, for example, are organized through the powerful and prestigious National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and televised by one of the United States’ biggest networks, CBS. According to Simson, the phrases “Grammy-nominated” and “Grammy winner” are key descriptors for artists that stay attached to them when promoting shows and in media coverage. “It’s just a headline, but it tells the reader, ‘Oh, this is a person who you have to pay attention to,’” Simson said. Stacy Merida, a voting member of NARAS with experience in marketing for artists during awards shows, agreed on the impact and importance of awards shows for those working in entertainment. “They really are kind of the culmination of a particular artist’s project,” Merida said. Merida said that these awards and their respective shows reward entertainers both intangibly and tangibly, by recognizing their hard work as well as boosting concert ticket sales, for example. ##Backlash, snubs and #Scammys Despite these awards shows representing prestige and success, they are also the subject of major backlash from the public. “#Scammys” has emerged as a trending hashtag on Twitter when the Grammy Awards air to express viewers’ disdain for who wins and who doesn’t. This outcry is made not for small artists, but for some of the biggest names in music, such as BTS, whose fans are credited with popularizing the Scammys hashtag, and The Weeknd, who was infamously “snubbed” for his 2020 album “After Hours” and its singles. Although Merida said she recognizes that artists can feel slighted, she defended the show. As a close friend of someone who works in putting on the Grammys, she said, she understands that programming the show to please audiences and recognize talented people in the industry is not easy. “I think a lot of times people are misinformed about the process,” Merida said. “It’s not a popularity contest; it’s not supposed to be a popularity contest.” Recently, some artists who feel they have been wronged by the Grammys have been turning that snubbing around by choosing not to submit their music for nomination or not attending the award shows at all if they are nominated. For the 2022 Grammys this past April, this included The Weeknd and Tyler, the Creator. Joe Caramanica, pop music critic at the New York Times, suggested that these “no-shows” could point to the creation of an alternate awards show. Who knows how the logistics of such a move could further hurt the Grammys’ viewership and relevancy to young people? Right now, young people are most likely to consider not only the Grammys, but the Emmys and Oscars as well, to be very relevant to them, according to a survey by the Morning Consult. Caramanica raised several criticisms of how the Grammys crafts their show’s performances; specifically, he wrote, they often feature the mega-popular young artists of today, but make up for catering to younger viewers by making sure their performances are rooted in styles familiar to, and comfortable for, older generations. Caramanica writes that, in doing this, the Grammys end up presenting “a kind of piteous compromise that holds real innovation at bay.” Simson acknowledged that a lot of thought and strategy goes into these performances, and that, ultimately, everything comes down to the network wanting ratings. “CBS is looking to get the widest possible audience they can,” Simson said. This raises the question — is that strategy working? Or is it making for a lackluster show of what the current music landscape has to offer, and the numbers are suffering because of it? Either way, Merida said she believes awards shows may change—for example, eventually switching from major broadcast networks to cable stations—but they’re here to stay. “I don’t think they’ll ever just go away,” Merida said. Simson said he does not see the Grammys, or any of the other three major awards shows, going anywhere anytime soon, even if their smaller competitors fizzle out. “We may see fewer of them, but the Oscars isn’t going away. The Tonys aren’t going away. The Emmys aren’t going away. The Grammys aren’t going away,” Simson said. While the chart above shows that a majority of adults are not particularly invested in the Grammys, it shows something else, too: a reliable faction of viewers. Even if the combined answers from “always” and “usually” make up just 20% of the total adult population, that is still one out of every five adults. Awards shows aren’t totally irrelevant just yet; the world will have to wait and see if the criticism balloons so much that these awards implode on themselves, or if they can find a way to live up to their own hype and gain back that precious viewership in the process." /> <meta property="og:description" content="John Simson remembers February 12, 2012.

Even if the combined answers from “always” and “usually” make up just 20% of the total adult population, that is still one out of every five adults. Awards shows aren’t totally irrelevant just yet; the world will have to wait and see if the criticism balloons so much that these awards implode on themselves, or if they can find a way to live up to their own hype and gain back that precious viewership in the process.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/spring-2022/connecticut-opioids/">&laquo; In rural Connecticut, non-profit clinics bear the brunt of the opioid crisis amid the coronavirus pandemic</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/spring-2022/adoptions/">Adoptions worldwide have decreased 85% &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/spring-2022/images/awards.png" alt="Awards show viewership continues low streak, prompting questions about relevancy"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/spring-2022/farmers-markets/">The Lack of Farmers Markets in New York’s Black Neighborhoods</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;04 May 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/spring-2022/yellowstone-traffic/">Road construction projects to cause major travel delays in Yellowstone National Park</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;04 May 2022</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/spring-2022/rent-pandemic/">The Pandemic’s Rent Problem: a Retrospective</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;04 May 2022</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/spring-2022/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
