In a densely populated city, it is imperative that responders can assess and react to emergency situations in a timely manner. In the 2022 annual MayorÕs Management Report of New York City, Mayor Eric Adams contextualized the work of the New York City Fire Department, or FDNY, as “first responders to more than 1.8 million fires, medical emergencies, and myriad other incidents that impact and threaten public safety each year, FDNY equitably protects the lives and property of all New York City residents and visitors.” New York City EMT Karol Materna said that he believes staffing shortages have plagued the Fire Department of New York ever since Covid-19 touched down in the city in March of 2020. According to Materna, “response times city wide has greatly increased as a result of staff shortages and elevated call volumes, and as a result of this, our cities first responders are struggling day in and day out with 16 hour mandated shifts with little compensation or recognition from upper management in our city.” Materna also noticed that 911 call volumes have been consistently higher, and even record breaking, in recent years which directly results in “slow response times when an ambulance has to travel upwards for 60-70 blocks for an imminent emergency due to lack of available units to handle the emergency.” Despite the importance of quick emergency response times, according to data provided by the City of New York about FDNY, the length of emergency response times increased 7% from 2010 to 2017, which is equal to an increase of 19.12 seconds slower in 7 years. Although an increase of around twenty seconds does not seem like a big deal, when fighting fires in a densely populated city, seconds can save lives and buildings. According to Ready.gov, a government website designed to educate the American public about preparedness and responses to emergencies, fires can spread extremely quickly. Specifically, “In less than 30 seconds a small flame can turn into a major fire. It only takes minutes for thick black smoke to fill a house or for it to be engulfed in flames.” Therefore, an almost linear increasing trend of slower response times for FDNY is extremely significant. There are many factors that can contribute to longer emergency response times in New York City. First, there have been wide-spread short staffing issues in the city. In an interview with Rebecca Greenberg for Spectrum News NY1, FDNY Local 2507 Union President, Oren Barzilay, who represents thousands of FDNY first responders, spoke about staffing shortages, “We are hurting out here and that’s why everybody leaves.” Due to short-staffing issues, emergency response teams are scrambling to respond to calls across all boroughs, “It’s an ongoing reshuffling of units every day, all day, and who suffers the most? The person who’s calling 911 for help,” Barzilay said. Examining both MaternaÕs and BarzilayÕs thoughts truly exposes the impact of not having enough essential staff. While emergency response teams in New York City are short staffed, there will be longer emergency response times as there are simply not enough resources for responders to get there in a faster amount of time. In addition to universal issues with being short-staffed, emergency response times also vary by borough. According to data from the City of New York from 2017 t0 2019, Brooklyn has the fastest emergency response time, the Bronx and Queens has the slowest. Average Income While there are many factors that can contribute to different average emergency response times by borough, average household income and estimates of uninsured individuals can help us understand the discrepancy. In data from the Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York, the non-profit organization shed light on the median incomes of families who live in New York City boroughs. Just as the Bronx has the slowest emergency response time, the borough also has the lowest average household income. Uninsured Individuals There is also a correlation between the number of uninsured individuals per capita and emergency response times. Just as the Bronx and Queens are the two boroughs with the slowest emergency response times, they are also the two boroughs with the largest percentages of uninsured individuals per capita. The highest being Queens at 32.06% of uninsured individuals per capita, compared to the lowest, Staten Island with 14.66% which has the second fastest emergency response time. It takes emergency responders the longest to attend to 911 calls in the Bronx (5 min 45 seconds) which is also the borough with the lowest average income ($41,432 per household) and the borough with the 2nd highest number of uninsured individuals per capita (28.47% of people). In an interview with Hosana Naod, who works in management consulting and lives in Manhattan, she said that it’s apparent that individuals who are uninsured have limited options when looking to receive emergency care, “Even further, if someone is in a more emergent situation and needs to go to urgent care for example, regardless of how minor the health situation is, the results will be costly and out of pocket fees will be much higher without the help of insurance.” When reflecting on the discrepancies in the system, Naod said, “there are definitely biases in place there, because unfortunately even healthcare is a business, and insurance plays a big part in how you are treated within those spaces.” In the 2022 MayorÕs Management Report of New York City, Mayor Eric Adams addressed the inconsistency in emergency response times by borough, “Over the course of many years, operational efforts combined with public education have helped reduce the number of serious fires and fire-related deaths, which historically have had a disproportionate impact on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. To address higher response times to life-threatening medical emergencies in certain parts of the Bronx and Queens, the Department developed strategies and provided additional resources that resulted in improved response times in those communities.” Although Mayor Adams did address the concerns of Naod and many other residents of New York City, until emergency response times improve and are equal in every borough, low-income communities, and boroughs, like the Bronx, will continue to suffer. Emergency response services should be outperforming their previous response times each year. Instead, in New York City, the response times are increasing which raises cause for concern.
