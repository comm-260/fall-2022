<p>The map shows the percentage of people living below the poverty line in each state.</p>

<p>The top states in the highest percentile of poverty also rank higher among hate crimes, as well as racial hate organizations as opposed to states with a lower poverty percentage.</p>

<p>The United States Census determines poverty rate by conducting surveys to find household income. The Southern Law Poverty Center tracks hate crimes and hate groups by organizations that “vilify others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.”</p>

<p>The SPLC defines a hate group as an “ organization or collection of individuals that – based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities – has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.”</p>

<p>Out of the 17 states in the highest poverty group, 12 of the states were located in the south. The highest group of states for poverty had 4.02 hate groups per capita while the least impoverished states averaged 2.26 hate groups per capita.</p>

<p>The chart depicts the correlation between poverty and hate groups. The poorest ranking states averaged more hate groups per capita were the least poorest states averaged lesser hate groups per capita.</p>

<p>With a poverty percent of 14%, North Carolina falls within  highest poverty and averaged 12.3 hate crimes and 2.62 hate groups. According to InterAction, a non-profit combating poverty, one of the driving factors behind poverty is inadequate access to food and water and limited education and job opportunity. These barriers are more likely to impact people of color, especially Blacks and Latinos.</p>

<p>Alex Hodge, a medical administrator in Burlington, North Carolina who volunteers at a local shelter has been a North Carolina resident for 20 years and witnessed poverty throughout the state.</p>

<p>“In particular, rural areas tend to be worse off and people of color who live in those communities are at a disadvantage,” Hodge said. “Volunteering gives me a chance to give back to my community and I hope in my lifetime we can work to eliminate poverty.”</p>

<p>According to the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, in 2019 about 15.4% of people living in rural areas had an income below the federal poverty line (which differs by states), compared to people living in urban areas who had a poverty rate of only 11.9%.</p>

<p>The increase in poverty in rural areas is attributed to factors such as restricted education, limited access to healthy food, and low employment opportunities.</p>

<p>The scatterplot shows hate crimes per capita against poverty rate which depicts the mild positive correlation illustrated by the positive slope of the linear trendline.</p>

<p>Racial hate groups in North Carolina have held recent rallies. In 2017,
Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County, a group formerly listed as a neo-confederate hate organization by the SPLC, held rally in Alamance County supporting the local Graham confederate monument.</p>

<p>“It was disheartening to see that kind of hate in our community. No one should ever feel intimidated in their own hometown,” Hodge said.</p>

<p>Kentucky is another state battling poverty coming in at the fifth highest state in the poverty ranking  averaging 25.3 hate crimes per capita and 2 hate groups per capita.</p>

<p>Kentucky has a history of racial violence including the murder of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, emergency medical technician, on March 13, 2020 in her home at night in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Tyra Richardson, a first year tennis player at the University of Louisville from Chicago Illinois  said being a black woman in Kentucky is at times feels intimidating.</p>

<p>“I feel a lot of tension in terms of race relations sometimes because it feels like you’re always in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Richardson said. “There should be more legislation supporting the black community.”</p>

<p>The Justice for Breonna Taylor Act was introduced to the senate on June 11, 2020 and signed into law by Kentucky’s Governor Andy Beshea. The bill prevents no-knock warrants and also requires police to wear body cameras while serving warrants.</p>

<p>Breonna Taylor’s death also raised awareness for The Say Her Name movement, started in 2014 by Critical Race Theory author Kimberlé Crenshaw, which aims to bring attention to abuse and police brutality against black identifying women.</p>

<p>President Biden released a statement advocating for legislative change.</p>

<p>“Breonna Taylor’s death was a tragedy, a blow to her family, her community, and America. As we continue to mourn her, we must press ahead to pass meaningful police reform in Congress. I remain committed to signing a landmark reform bill into law.”</p>

<p>Another southern state battling racial inequality is Alabama which ranked in the top percentile among poverty and averaged 2.58 hate groups per capita. The state did not report their hate crimes. Lt. Col Benard Simelton, a life member and President of Alabama’s National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, says that systemic racism plays a role in the development of hate organizations.</p>

<p>“We want to raise awareness within the government and have people go through anti-bias training to recognize those biases which has to start with law enforcement and judges who sentence people. At times our criminal justice system isn’t fair,” Simelton said.</p>

<p>The NAACP is a civil rights organization with a mission to promote equality for minority citizens in the United States. According to its website, the organization has over 2,200 chapters across the country. The Alabama NAACP was established in 1913 and was one of the leading southern states to implement the organization.</p>

<p>Simelton has been an Alabama resident for 21 years and also serves on the Diversity Committee for The Red Cross of North Alabama.</p>

<p>“The Red Cross is a great organization, and has been around for hundreds of years and helped people. It’s no secret when disaster strikes, it comes through and destroys neighborhoods, and what we see is The Red Cross will set up headquarters in white communities and black people have to drive long distances to get serviced.”</p>

<p>Simelton has dedicated his career to dismantling racism and raising awareness for systemic inequalities. He plans to continue to fight for the state of Alabama and is committed to combating racism.</p>

<p>“I wanted to make change for Black people and all the people who are discriminated against.”</p>
