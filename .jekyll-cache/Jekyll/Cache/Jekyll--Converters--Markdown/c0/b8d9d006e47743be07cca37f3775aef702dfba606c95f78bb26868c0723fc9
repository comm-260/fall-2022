I"W<p>It has been observed that men and women earn significantly different wages, even within similar industries and positions. New Jersey is no exception to this norm, as women on average earn only up to about 80% of what men earn across every county, if that. Industries that are female-dominated are most likely to pay lower wages overall than male-dominated ones. Additionally, female-dominated jobs also are less likely to include benefits like employer-provided health insurance and retirement plans compared to male-dominated occupations. Interestingly enough, even within female-dominated industries, women are paid less on average than men with the same job position. When comparing over 300 different occupations, there are zero where women have an earnings advantage over men, but many where men have significantly higher earnings than women.</p>
