I"Ú$<p>The District of Columbia has been notoriously known for its high rates of homelessness, in the Tidal Basin, some can see the beautiful views of our nation‚Äôs capital, but also the number of homeless people and their camps set up under bridges and trees. In December 2021, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/dc-poll-housing-homeless-bowser/">Mayor Muriel Bowser</a> announced the removal of hundreds of encampments across the district, despite having low efforts of creating more affordable housing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe young black male at the mall sitting at the table looks as if he‚Äôs just a regular ‚Äúyouth‚Äù chillin‚Äô at the mall, but is homeless,‚Äù  said Joe Savage, Regional Coordinator at the US interagency council on Homelessness ‚ÄúSame with the white female at the subway station with a backpack who looks like a student‚Äù</p>

<p>Within the National homeless population, a growing demographic at risk is unaccompanied youths ages 18-24. However in DC, there has been a decrease in homeless youth;  in 2020 DC reported there were 548 unaccompanied homeless youth. In this past year‚Äôs Point in Time count, an annual survey conducted by DC and many other states that counts the overall and sheltered homeless population, it was found that the number of unaccompanied youth has decreased to 502.  This has been the lowest number of unaccompanied youth reported in the last five years, but in 2016 it was reported that an alarming 902 youths ages 18-24 were homeless. However the Point In Time count has received <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/dc-poll-housing-homeless-bowser/__;!!IaT_gp1N!3YwjToMSvZB1dnVVukd2gUaTicC7kP50_X_qGsU5QZw4hgnORR9QZEb28mUEBC7-xut4VNinBijkDHwv6VAGH4n3Ag$">speculation</a>  that it could be undercounting sub-populations and the number of those unsheltered, since the survey takes place during a 10 day period in January.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhile homeless youth come from varied backgrounds, one of the largest demographics is youth who identify as LGBTQ+‚Äù Said Savage ‚Äú Particularly, there is an overrepresentation of LGBTQ+ youth of color‚Äù</p>

<p>Currently of those 502 unaccompanied homeless youth, 277 of them are black youths between the ages of 18-25 and only 25 identify as transgender.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnother large segment is runaway youth for whom there has been some type of family conflict or abuse‚Äù Said Savage ‚ÄúFinally, you have pregnant and parenting youth who after moving from place-to-place are unable to find a stable, safe, and permanent home.‚Äù</p>

<p>DC currently reports that there are 5,111 homeless people in the area, an estimated 86% of the homeless population is black; Despite only 46% of DC‚Äôs population is black</p>

<p>Based on the 2021 PIT count, the ward with the most homeless population is Ward 6; where many well known encampments reside such as Union station, Chinatown, and Capitol Hill. Just recently, <a href="https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/dc-encampment-tent-housing-federal/*.Yl71gfXMK3I">the national park service</a> closed down Capitol Hill Park due to the encampments being a ‚Äúsafety hazard‚Äù, leaving many encampment residents with nowhere to go.  Ward 6 is also home to one of DC‚Äôs new short term housing properties. The Aya, built in 2020 houses 50 families every night and was part of Mayor Bowser‚Äôs HomewardDC plan.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

<p>Although Ward 6 had the highest overall homeless population, Ward 2 had the highest unsheltered homeless population at 296. <a href="https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/dc-evicts-30-homeless-residents-park-new-jersey-o-nw-surrounds-fences/*.Yl74hfXMK3I">Last December</a>, a number of encampment residents in a park located on the corner of New Jersey Ave. and O street, were evicted and displaced from their homes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOne of the key strategies is actually involving youth with lived expertise of homelessness in the policy and decision-making processes‚Äù said Savage ‚ÄúBy doing this, communities are using their expertise to assist with identifying homeless youth and developing effective interventions for addressing youth homelessness‚Äù</p>

<p>To combat this unseen problem within homelessness in DC, many organizations have taken upon themselves to implement ways to provide support for unaccompanied youth. One of these organizations is the Covenant House Greater Washington, founded in 1995. The CHGW provides housing, workforce development, job/career placement, and mental health services.</p>

<p>Another organization combating this issue is the <a href="https://www.sashabruce.org/">Sasha Bruce Youthwork</a>, a streetwork project created in 1976 by Deborah Shore. Today, the Sasha Bruce Youthwork is DC‚Äôs largest provider for homeless youth, SBY provides children and young adults with housing, life skills, career training, and education.</p>

<p>At American University, Many students have provided their support in helping those in need through Heal Da Homies. <a href="https://healdahomies.org/">Heal Da Homies</a> was founded by students during the height of the pandemic, and now provides mutual aid to marginalized communities by organizing flea markets, and food drives.</p>

<p>On April 21, Mayor Bowser, joined by the DC Department of Human services and DC Interagency Council on Homelessness, held a <a href="https://dhs.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announce-2022-point-time-count-results-and-highlight-fy23-budget-investments">conference</a> to discuss the results of the <a href="https://community-partnership.org/homelessness-in-dc/*pit-dashboard">2022 Point In Time count</a> and highlights of the FY23 Budget investments. Part of these investments included $31 million to Homeward DC, a strategic plan created by the mayor in 2016 to combat homelessness and make it non recurring. And more than $114 million towards replacing shelters, with smaller and more service enriched family housing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhile we are proud of these results, we know there‚Äôs more work to do. We know that the pandemic has changed the way people experience homelessness, including more people living in encampments, and we need to be responsive to those changes.‚Äù Said Mayor Bowser at the press conference ‚ÄúWith the FY23 budget, we have the funding in place to end chronic homelessness, and in addition to the funding, we have the political will and the community support to make it happen. And we will.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mayor Bowser shared that the 2022 PIT count showed that the number of homeless individuals in DC currently is 4,410. Which is  47% lower than the PIT count of 2016, the same year Homeward DC was created; And 13.7% lower than last year‚Äôs PIT count.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMayor Bowser‚Äôs proposed FY23 budget continues to invest in solutions to the crisis of homelessness,‚Äù said DHS Director Laura Green Zeilinger. ‚ÄúWhile I am proud of the work we do to connect District residents to affordable housing, I am especially proud of the system by which we welcome people home ‚Äì it‚Äôs a system consistent with our District values in that it is centered in human dignity. Our residents are deserving of a safe and stable place to call home and we are dedicated to making that vision a reality.‚Äù</p>
