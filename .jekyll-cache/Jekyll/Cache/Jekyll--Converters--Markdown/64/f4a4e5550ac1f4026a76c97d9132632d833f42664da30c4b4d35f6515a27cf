I"±<p>More people are affected by witnessing mass shootings every day, especially as more death-related incidents arise. The FBI defines mass shootings as a set of firearm and homicide incidents with ‚Äú4 or more victims,‚Äù says Tulane University Criminology Professor W. Allen. Despite the number of people involved, mass shootings are difficult to interpret. The 2010s were notable for increased deaths because of U.S. mass shootings. Many U.S. cities and states have seen significant changes in mass shooting deaths based on the public‚Äôs awareness of them. However, those trends have continued to increase during the early 2020s, creating different causes for fewer or more deaths.</p>
