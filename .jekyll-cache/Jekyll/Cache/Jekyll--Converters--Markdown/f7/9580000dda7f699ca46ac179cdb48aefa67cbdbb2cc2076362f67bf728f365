I" <p>Healthcare spending in the United States has always been among the most important political issues the country has faced over the past century. Despite spending the most per capita on healthcare in the developed world, the United States has the lowest life expectancy and highest infant mortality rates out of any country. The US spends more than $12,000 per person per capita on healthcare but people in the U.S. can expect to live three to four years less than others in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.</p>
