I"´/<p>The city has gotten used to excessive danger. How the arrest rates of NYC suggest a continuation of increased crime.</p>

<p>Plaguing New York City, assault accounts for 16.5% of all arrest records across the five boroughs. However, when looking at the data, it‚Äôs not as simple as it seems. The Gotham City of the real world, crime in New York City is nothing new. We have all heard stories or experienced the horror stories of the different crimes that happen in the infamous NYC. In fact, the overall index crime in New York City has increased by 26% since August 2021.  With crime worsening, it is important to know what kinds of crimes are being committed more often. It‚Äôs very different if your neighborhood has an increase in tax fraud over an increase in murders.</p>

<p>Different neighborhoods within the boroughs have different common arrest types. While in all the boroughs assault has the highest arrest records, the next data point varies. Assault does account for 17% of all arrests, across 58 different categories. While 17% does not sound like a large percentage, when you look at how many categories of different arrest types there are, you will see why it is such a prevalent issue. The second-highest arrest types differ for a few boroughs. In Manhattan, petite larceny has the greatest amount of arrests. In The Bronx, felony assaults have the greatest, along with Brooklyn and Queens. In Staten Island, vehicles and traffic laws.</p>

<p>Moving down the list of arrest types, besides the top three, the boroughs differ quite a lot in the types of crime that are the most prevalent in their area.</p>

<p>The boroughs are all very different in population size. When looking at the number of arrest rates adjusted for population, one borough quickly rose above the rest. If you have lived in New York, you already know which borough that is.</p>

<p>The Bronx. The Bronx has the highest arrest rate per capita at 22.21 arrests per 1,000. The Bronx has earned itself quite the reputation for being the more dangerous of the boroughs, and one of the most dangerous spots in the state. In fact, the Bronx is home to numerous neighborhoods that hold some of the highest crime rates in NYC. When it comes to violent crime, the Bronx has almost twice the rates of those in Brooklyn and Manhattan. As for Staten Island and Queens? You are nearly three times more likely to experience violent crime in the Bronx than them.</p>

<p>You may wonder, what types of people are getting arrested the most often. The data for this is unsurprisingly the same across all the boroughs. 83% of all the perpetrators arrested this year were men. The age group with the most arrests is those aged 25-44, accounting for 39% of all arrests. Adjusting for the population in all the boroughs, 50% of all arrests are black people.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information, Julian Phillips, arrest profiles remain unchanged in the past few decades. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gone in-depth on our own data, and it has remained consistent. Men have almost always been arrested on a much higher percentage than women for a variety of different reasons. We have to deal with a lot of violent arrests, and more often than not it‚Äôs the men being violent. [‚Ä¶] As for age, we have a lot of arrests that are over assaults, drugs, and fraud, so it‚Äôs not surprising that the highest percentage isn‚Äôt teenagers or the elderly,‚Äù said Phillips. These consistent profiles of perpetrators may give insight into what is most common, however it is important to stay vigilant and remember that anyone can commit a crime. There is no age group, sex, and race that has never committed a crime. Nevertheless, it is always good to see the data and decipher which have the highest arrest rates.</p>

<p>Expert criminologist Jeff Fagan has spent part of his career recognizing patterns in racial profiling and police. ‚ÄúTwo case studies show surprising and troubling similarities in the racial disparities in the new policing in vastly different areas, including more frequent police contact and new forms of monetary punishment,‚Äù said Fagan. ‚ÄúLow-level ‚Äúpublic order‚Äù crimes and misdemeanors are the starting point for legal proceedings that over time evolve into punishments leading to criminal records with lasting consequences.‚Äù These racial injustices are not new and continue to plague not only NYC, but in districts across the US.</p>

<p>The increase in crime in NYC has been visible to the public. Queens native, Hannah Goldberg, is a 44-year-old public worker who has seen the changing landscape of safety across the boroughs. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine being able to roam the streets freely as a kid as we did back then. I now carry multiple self-defense items and make sure people know where I am and when. I work in Manhattan now, and my commute has seen quite a few crimes over the years,‚Äù said Goldberg. Goldberg spoke of experiences she had on public transportation, as well as the avoidance of certain places. ‚ÄúMy girlfriends and I would go to the Bronx in our 20s, because that‚Äôs where it was hip. We now avoid the area entirely√â too much crime on the news to bother going there,‚Äù she said. This experience is not uncommon, as talking to a few of her coworkers that had similar perspectives on which areas were safer than others. ‚ÄúI always warn my kids to stay away from certain areas,‚Äù said fellow employee David Peters. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre teenagers, so they like to explore. I always make sure to equip them with defensive tools, even if they think they don‚Äôt need them. I make them stay away from a majority of places. I find Brooklyn to be increasingly dangerous as well.‚Äù  Mr. Peters is correct here, as Brooklyn has the most arrest records this year.</p>

<p>Millionaires also play a role in arrest races per borough. The borough with the most millionaires, Manhattan has the most, with 13,818 millionaires. This actually accounts for 42% of the entire state‚Äôs millionaires. In total, 32,810 New York tax filers earn more than $1 million a year. Manhattan proves a stark difference from the rest of the boroughs. In the outer boroughs (Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens), less than 2% make at least $200,000 per year. It is normal for areas with lower average income to have higher arrest rates. The Bronx plays right into this, being the poorest borough while having the highest arrest rate. However, going back to Manhattan, Manhattan is considered the wealthiest borough and yet has the second highest arrest rate. Even adjusting for population numbers, the answer remains the same. Expert criminologist Jeff Fagan believes that it is because of the number of expensive people, stores, and places in Manhattan that make it such a special target of crime. ‚ÄúManhattan is unlike the other boroughs when it comes to crime because of how wealthy it is. Everyone likes the allure of Manhattan, and it is where the rich of the rich come to play. The obscene amounts of wealth are why it‚Äôs so targeted,‚Äù said Fagan. This proves that no matter how wealthy your neighborhood is, everyone can possibly be the victim of a crime.</p>

<p>As crime continues to rise in NYC, all citizens must remain diligent in safety precautions. Last year, the NYPD reported a total of 102,741 major felonies. As this year‚Äôs data shows, it is only getting worse. In a press release done by the NYPD, they stated increases across the board. ‚ÄúFive of the seven major index-crime categories saw increases, driven by a 22.7% increase in burglary (1,409 v. 1,148), a 21.5% increase in grand larceny auto (1,215 v. 1,000), and a 21.3% increase in grand larceny (4,552 v. 3,753),‚Äù the press release said. Whether or not this trend will change in the future is yet to be determined as NYPD has not outlined any plans to attempt to lessen crime rates. While not stating a plan of action, officials remain optimistic about working for the people of New York. NYPD Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell said, ‚ÄúOne crime victim is one victim too many, and the hardworking women and men of the NYPD are committed to ensuring that no one√ëin any New York City neighborhood√ëis harmed by violence or disorder.‚Äù Only time will be able to tell if Sewell makes changes to attempt to follow this statement. The people of New York deserve to feel safe in their own city and not have to worry about being victims of crimes on every corner.</p>
