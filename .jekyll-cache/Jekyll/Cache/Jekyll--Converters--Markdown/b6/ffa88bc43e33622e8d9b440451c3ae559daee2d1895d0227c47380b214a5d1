I"z#<p>K-12 school shooting incidents in the United States have continued to increase over recent years. Since 1991, the fatality of these incidents is similarly on the rise to the concern of experts, students, and parents.</p>

<p><em>Line chart of the number of fatal school shootings per year from 1991 to 2022.</em></p>

<p>From 2018 to the present, an average of 27 fatal school shooting incidents occur per year in the U.S. Numbers this large have not been seen since 1993 when 32 fatal incidents took place in American schools across the country.</p>

<p>Since this spike, the U.S. saw an average of only eight fatal shootings per year from 1994 to 2017. The past four years show an average number of yearly shootings nearly 3.5 times the average of the previous 23-year period.</p>

<p>From 1991 to 2022, a total of 386 fatal school shootings occurred in the U.S. States such as Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi have seen some of the highest rates of fatal school shootings with 21, 22, and 21 fatal school shootings incidents per capita by ten million individuals, respectively from 1991 to 2022.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-problem"><strong>Exploring the problem</strong></h2>

<p>David Riedman is the creator of the <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/">K-12 School Shooting Database</a>, a dataset that documents every instance a gun is pulled, fired, or a bullet hits K-12 school property for any reason. Riedman began compiling the dataset during his time with the Homeland Security Advanced Thinking Program at the Naval Postgraduate School in 2018.</p>

<p>Prior to 2018, there was no comprehensive national database for school shooting incidents. Riedman and his research partner compiled the database using information from news stories, Google alerts, and social media.</p>

<p>Riedman emphasized the importance of recognizing the scale of the issue. Through the data, it is clear that school shootings are a national issue, impacting students in every state.</p>

<p>“[School shooting incidents] are really spread everywhere. This happens in all sized communities – urban, suburban, rural – and in every part of the country. There have been shootings in every single state,” said Riedman.</p>

<p>All over the country, there has been an increase in the number of victims and the fatality of K-12 school shootings.</p>

<p>“Planned attacks – situations like Uvalde, Parkland, or Oxford – are relatively steady, but the number of victims and the number of fatalities is increasing in recent years,” said Riedman.</p>

<h2 id="gun-control-laws"><strong>Gun control laws</strong></h2>

<p>Gun control laws aim to regulate the possession and purchase of firearms, including the types of guns that may be owned, waiting periods required for purchase, and the classification of persons who are prohibited from owning firearms.</p>

<p>States across America have varying levels of gun control laws with some being stricter than others. The aforementioned states of note (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee) have relatively low levels of gun control laws with 19 in Louisiana, 10 in Mississippi, and 24 in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Riedman argues that gun control laws may be effective in limiting public mass shootings but their effect in minimizing school shootings remains questionable.</p>

<p>“In terms of school shootings, the majority of perpetrators are students. They’re mostly middle school and high school students; they’re under 18. They’re not allowed to purchase weapons in any state already. They’re getting their guns from someone else – that’s not something that can be solved legally at the point of sale,” said Riedman.</p>

<p>The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a gun rights advocacy organization based in the U.S. The NRA states that gun control laws have relatively little effect on violent crime rates across the country.</p>

<p>“In fact, cities with some of the most stringent gun laws, like New York and Chicago, suffer from some of the highest violent crime rates,” <a href="https://www.nraila.org/why-gun-control-doesn-t-work/">according to the organization’s website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-gun-violence-on-school-children-in-america"><strong>The impact of gun violence on school children in America</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the debated effectiveness of gun control laws, it remains that gun violence has a particular impact on school children in America.</p>

<p>John Woodrow Cox is a reporter from the Washington Post who has extensively researched gun violence’s effect on school children in America. He worked extensively on the Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/">database on school shootings</a>.</p>

<p>“When somebody is shot, they’re going to have lifelong psychological and physical consequences from it,” said Cox.</p>

<p>For nationally recognized incidents, victims may be provided resources and care from the public, but with smaller skirmishes, victims are often left with little help.</p>

<p>“If it’s a nationally known incident, there are GoFundMes set up and insurance funds and resources for victims for the rest of their lives, but there can be a bystander that’s shot during a fight in the hallway and that person is going to have really serious injuries,” said Riedman.</p>

<p>School children in America have spoken out about the impacts of gun violence in schools. The Stoneman Douglas Shooting in Parkland, Florida on Feb. 14, 2018, took the lives of 17 high school students. Student survivors of the shooting have spoken out about gun violence and the need for gun control.</p>

<p>“We have grown up in this country and watched violence unfold to no resolution. We have watched people with the power and authority to make changes fail to do so,” <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/emma-gonzalez-parkland-gun-control-cover">said X (previously Emma) Gonzalez</a>.</p>
