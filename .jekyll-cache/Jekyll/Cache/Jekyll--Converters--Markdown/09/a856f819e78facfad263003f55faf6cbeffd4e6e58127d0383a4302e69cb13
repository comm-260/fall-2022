I"é<p>Los Angeles County is home to global celebrities who live in lavish wealth, their wealth displayed in their million-dollar homes, fancy sports cars, and designer clothes. However there is a less glamorous part of Los Angeles County, in neighborhoods such as Compton and Inglewood <a href="https://www.comptoncity.org/our-city/visitors/about-compton/demographic-information">nearly 20% of people live in poverty</a>. Crime rates are higher, education level is lower, and it is much more common to be a victim of police brutality. In Los Angeles Countyâ€™s five poorest neighborhoods, there have been 155 people killed by police brutality since 2000. In the ten richest neighborhoods, there have been 30x less. There is a great wealth disparity in Los Angelesâ€™ neighborhoods, and poor, predominantly non-white neighborhoods are the ones suffering from police brutality. In many other cities such as Tulsa, Oklahoma, Los Angeles County has remained <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/09/12/interview-how-policing-one-us-city-hurts-black-and-poor-communities">highly segregated, with black residents living in poverty at much higher rates than white people,</a> subjected to worse health, shorter life spans, higher crime, and aggressive policing.</p>
