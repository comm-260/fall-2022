I"ÉB<p>In 2016, writer Hana Nobel attempted to dine at five of San Franciscoâ€™s worst Yelp-rated restaurants. The experiment was cut short after Nobel got food poisoning at the fourth restaurant on the list. The buzz generated by Nobelâ€™s <a href="https://thebolditalic.com/i-visited-san-francisco-s-worst-rated-yelp-restaurants-and-got-food-poisoning-the-bold-italic-e326c6b1d47b">subsequent article</a>, published by the Bold Italic, fed into an easy consumer conclusion: that low Yelp ratings correlate with unsanitary restaurant conditions. Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of Yelp, reinforced this conclusion, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremys/status/634173246271676416">retweeting Nobelâ€™s article, writing: â€œWhat happens when you eat at a number of restaurants with extremely low @yelp ratings? Bet you can guessâ€¦â€</a></p>

<p>The presumed correlation between low Yelp ratings and inspection grades has floated around in public thought for years, much to the dismay of restaurant owners. However, an analysis between public Yelp data and restaurant inspection grades in Maricopa County, Ariz., shows that there is no definitive correlation between low Yelp ratings and inspection grades. Average Yelp ratings are around 3.5 stars, regardless of inspection score.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4582513"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>Average inspection scores are in the 90s (A grades) across Yelp star ratings. Restaurants with 1-star or 5-star Yelp ratings, the highest and lowest possible ratings, are outliers. Only 3 percent of Maricopa restaurants in the analysis have a 5-star Yelp rating, and only 2 percent have a 5-star rating. Eighty-six percent of restaurants are concentrated within the 2.5-star to 4.5-star range.</p>

<p>Nothing on Yelpâ€™s platform offers a clear indication of cleanliness: not food cuisine tags, not zip codes, not even high Yelp ratings. Yelp users cannot use the forum to predict whether or not a restaurant is sanitary, yet, as Stoppelmanâ€™s Tweet demonstrates, the forum promotes the idea that they can.</p>

<p>Nobel herself does not believe that Yelp ratings are generally indicative of bad sanitation. She concludes that most reviews usually focus on food quality and customer service, instead of sanitation practices. Though unfortunate, the results of Nobelâ€™s experiment were not necessarily unexpectedâ€“she had compiled her list by searching Yelp for the keywords â€œworstâ€ and â€œfood poisoning.â€ She still doesnâ€™t take Yelp reviews at face value, especially for indicating a restaurantâ€™s sanitation level.</p>

<p>â€œThings have to be really bad for someone to notice and put that in a reviewâ€“like cockroaches on the floor or pigeons in the restaurant,â€ She says. The latter Nobel experienced in Chinatown Restaurant during her experiment. She notes, â€œPeople donâ€™t usually know what goes on in the kitchen.â€</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-yelp-ratings-on-restaurants">The impact of Yelp ratings on restaurants</h2>

<p>Restaurant owners are well-aware of the distance between Yelp ratings and inspection scores.</p>

<p>Rachel and Tim Lyons co-owned two high-end restaurants in Durham, NC: Primal Foods &amp; Spirits and Blu Seafood and Bar. Both restaurants closed in 2018, but Rachel Lyons remembers the negative impact Yelp had on both businesses.</p>

<p>Before joining the restaurant business, the Lyonses heard that Yelp would prioritize a restaurantâ€™s negative reviews unless the restaurant chose to advertise with them. Many businesses complained about this issue in the early 2010s and the topic garnered massive media attention. The website <a href="https://yelp-sucks.com/tell-your-yelp-story/">www.yelp-sucks.com</a> was created for small business owners to voice their frustrations with the forum.</p>

<p>When Yelp reached out to the Lyonses with an advertisement opportunity for their restaurants, they declined. As a result, they noticed negative reviews populating the top of their Yelp page. The bigger problem, Rachel Lyons notes, is that many of the reviews were unfair, posted by customers who either didnâ€™t give the restaurant a chance to redeem itself for a mistake, or did not understand upscale dining.</p>

<p>â€œMistakes do happen,â€ Lyons says. â€œUnfortunately, people can go to Yelp and just write down a bad review without even giving that opportunity to make everything better.â€</p>

<p>Blu was a small, locally-owned restaurant that sourced its seafood from high-quality sellers. Lyons says that a frequent problem was that customers would judge the restaurant by Red Lobster standards, and complain on Yelp.</p>

<p>â€œ[High-quality] ingredients cost more,â€ she says. â€œWhen someone would then write a review about the portion sizes being too small, that, just with their stars, brings our rating down.â€</p>

<p>Additionally, Yelp does not have a system of verification that proves customers ate at a restaurant or used a business. Lyons remembers one example of a rival business owner leaving a fraudulent review on Primalâ€™s Yelp page using a fake account. The Lyonses contacted Yelp in the hopes of having the review removed. They were unsuccessful. Though Primal is now closed, the fraudulent review is still on its Yelp page. Eleven Yelpers marked it as â€œuseful.â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s really your word against the public,â€ Lyons says. â€œSomeone who may not have even ever come to your restaurant but simply doesnâ€™t like you for another reason can go online and make anything up and be published. And that hurts your business.â€</p>

<h2 id="preference-based-reviews">Preference-based reviews</h2>

<p>On top of fraudulent and misplaced reviews, many Yelp reviews are preference-based. In Maricopa County, where around 24,000 businesses are listed on Yelp, the phrase â€œmy preferenceâ€ appears in 240 unique reviews, as does the phrase â€œfor my taste.â€ Yelp only allows 240 results per keyword search, so the real figures are likely much higher.</p>

<p>After Yelper Aileen C. ate at Roaring Fork Restaurant in Maricopa County, she left a 3.5-star review. She wrote: â€œDisclaimer: I only went to the happy hourâ€¦ Citrus Mojito: Eh. Not great. It wasnâ€™t citrus-y enough for me, but that may be just personal preferenceâ€¦ Overall, it was fine but I do want to try it for regular dinner one night because I have had friends give Roaring Fork raving reviews.â€</p>

<p>Lyons thinks that the Yelp Elite program might have something to do with preference-based reviews.</p>

<p>Yelp Elite is a program in which, after posting a high number of reviews and regularly engaging with other users on Yelp, a Yelper earns a special profile tag that labels them as â€œElite.â€ Elite members are invited to exclusive events hosted by Yelp. Through Yelp Elite, Yelpers are rewarded for writing reviews when they may not have otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="yelps-health-scores">Yelpâ€™s health scores</h2>

<p>Not long after Nobelâ€™s article was published, Yelp started posting â€œhealth scoresâ€ on most restaurant pages, a practice that had previously only been instituted in a handful of cities. The health scores do not represent recent state or county grades, but rather an algorithmic average based on past scores and violations.</p>

<p>One problem with this system, Lyons notes, is that inspection violations donâ€™t always represent cleanliness.</p>

<p>â€œPeople always think itâ€™s just about how clean your restaurant is,â€ she says, â€œbut really it has a lot to do with where things are located. Sometimes, because these inspections are not known in advance, the inspector will just show up and you may be in the midst of receiving a shipment. You can be unfairly graded simply because youâ€™re just in the midst of putting things away.â€</p>

<p>Restaurateurs often refer to inspection scores as a â€œsnapshotâ€ of time that does not represent their overall reputation.</p>

<p>In her Mercury News article <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/09/yelps-new-health-scores-dont-mean-what-you-think-they-do/">â€œWhatâ€™s in a Number: Yelpâ€™s New Health Scores Donâ€™t Mean What You Think They Do,â€</a> writer Jessica Yadegaran unpacks the controversies surrounding Yelpâ€™s health scores.</p>

<p>In the article, Yadegaran talks to Golden Gate Restaurant Association representative Gwyneth Borden. Borden reinforces the unreliable nature of inspection scores, saying, â€œThe things you got in trouble for, you fix. You have a reinspection within one week. You have to live with the bad score.â€</p>

<p>Yelpâ€™s system, Borden concludes, is neither transparent nor fair. She notes that, in 2015, San Francisco businesses that were flagged for major violations lost business by an average of 15 percent. A <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2018/03/study-low-hygiene-scores-yelp-lead-decrease-consumer-purchase-intent">2018 study</a> promoted by Yelp found that Yelpâ€™s health scores decrease traffic for businesses with low scores by 12 percent compared to businesses with high scores.</p>

<p>Lyons, Borden, and Nobel conclude that Yelp yields an unfair and unreliable power over businesses.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-inspection-data">The problem with inspection data</h2>

<p>For consumers who care about restaurant sanitation, state and county records may be as unreliable as Yelpâ€™s health scores.</p>

<p>In Maricopa County, for example, receiving a public inspection grade is voluntary for restaurants.</p>

<p>Sanitarian Jaime Vinaras works for the Maricopa Health Department.</p>

<p>He describes that, while the Maricopa Health Department is responsible for the countyâ€™s mandatory inspections, restaurants choose whether or not they want their grades to be public. If not, their scores are published on the Maricopa Health Department website as â€œNot Participating.â€ Specific violations are not made public, but the count of violations and past A grades in the past three years are. The Maricopa Health Department has repeatedly asserted that this information is enough for members of the public to understand a restaurantâ€™s overall safety level.</p>

<p>â€œNothing in state law in Arizona says that a restaurant has to have a grade,â€ says Vinaras. As a result, of the 24,000 Maricopa County restaurant inspections between Aug. 4, 2016, and July, 25, 2019, 44 percent were marked as â€œNot Participating.â€</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4583935"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>According to Maricopa Health Department law, <a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5861/Grade-Card-Guidance-Document-PDF?bidId=">restaurants are given the choice to have their inspection grades published prior to inspection</a>. Even though inspections occur randomly, when they do, restaurant owners can make educated guesses about their businessâ€™ sanitation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, of the 13,544 restaurant inspections with published grades, 82 percent were A grades.</p>

<p>The incentive for a restaurant to choose public grading is to showcase cleanliness to customers, but some restaurants still receive imperfect grades. Out of the 24,000 inspections, 83 received D grades, 302 received C grades, and 2,073 received B grades.</p>

<p>Vinaras says that the Maricopa Health Department hasnâ€™t seen any glaring trends of restaurants with low-inspection scores being concentrated in certain cuisine types or locations. He chose not to comment on the accuracy of Yelpâ€™s health scores, but emphasized that the companyâ€™s system was different from that of the Maricopa Health Department.</p>

<p>The only clear external indicator of a restaurantâ€™s cleanliness, he notes, is whether or not it has Active Managerial Control (AMC), a designated food safety management team. â€œRestaurants that have active food safety management have better control over food safety practices,â€ he says.</p>

<p>There is no existing database of restaurants with safety management teams, and this information is not as accessible to the average consumer as, for example, a Yelp rating.</p>

<p>Ironically, inspection grading systems like Maricopaâ€™s are the reason for Yelpâ€™s algorithmic health scores.</p>

<p>â€œThereâ€™s an incentive for health inspectors and restaurateurs to have esoteric language that keeps consumers out of the loop,â€ Luther Lowe, Yelpâ€™s vice president for public policy, <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/184847/do-yelps-health-scores-accurately-capture-the-cleanliness-of-dc-restaurants/">told the Washington City Paper</a>. â€œWeâ€™re trying to give them a seat at the table.â€</p>

<p>## A world without Yelp</p>

<p>In 2020, restaurateur Billy Godwin took over the Sunrise Cafe in Maricopa County after the original owners lost the business during the Covid-19 lockdown. Though the cafe has an added â€œNewâ€ in its name, the original Yelp page still exists, with corresponding contact information, hours of operation, and recent reviews.</p>

<p>The restaurant has a 3-star rating, a relatively low score for the Maricopa area. When asked about Yelpâ€™s impact on his business, Goodwin was surprised to learn the restaurant was even listed. He says online reviews arenâ€™t something he plans to incorporate into the New Sunrise Cafeâ€™s business model.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™re a family-run business,â€ Godwin says. â€œYou want to make everyone happy, but we focus on customers who walk through the door and the food we serve them.â€</p>

<p>Only a few months into its new ownership, business at the New Sunrise Cafe is booming.</p>
