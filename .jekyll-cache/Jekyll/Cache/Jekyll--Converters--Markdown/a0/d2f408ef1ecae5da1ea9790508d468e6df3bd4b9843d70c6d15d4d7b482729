I"%<p>Trends in elections have been consistent throughout the past century, the midterms see less turnout than presidential elections and young voters have had the lowest turnout. In an increasingly polarized environment, however, youths have stepped up to the plate to encourage voting among their peers.</p>

<p>Young, educated voters have been a consistent demographic for Liberal politicians. Democratic candidates have begun placing more emphasis on their turnout. One such campaign was the 2020 “Settle for Biden” campaign. On the media team was American University Sophomore Finn O’Donnell.<br />
In a year where social media was flooded with election related content, much of his work was posting on platforms such as Instagram and Twitter with news and information regarding voting and issues. 
“A good amount of the popularity of infographics, was that we found a way we can communicate effectively,” O’Donnell said. “And we can get engagement and shares”<br />
An essential part of the information given out was the reach and legibility it had. In this “era of infographics,” as O’Donnell put it, the number of shares and likes a post got was the marker of how successful they were.<br />
In his college experience, O’Donnell notes how voter turnout varies from other less politically oriented universities. 
“At American University, most people are upper middle class, and a lot of people have some form of marginalized identity or identify that way. I think those two things create a higher propensity to vote,” O’Donnell said. 
The message the “Settle for Biden” campaign carried was one that can be disheartening to young voters: to vote for the lesser of two evils. It was, however, more focused and encouraging than those of the 2016 presidential election.<br />
Then Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, is well known for her folksy remarks like “PokŽmon Go to the Polls.” In contrast, the “Settle for Biden” campaign’s push helped provide young voters with information on how to vote and links to sources to help them. 
Where previous campaigns had fewer effective appeals to younger voters, the common sense and access to resources proved valuable in getting out the vote in the 2020 election where a record 48% of voters aged 18 to 24 turned out to vote.<br />
A similar approach to getting first-time voters to get to the polls was facilitated by American University Freshman Sophia Cummings. In high school, Cummings was part of two clubs that combined to help promote pre-registration, Vote-16 and the League of Women Voters.<br />
“I was just curious; I didn’t know that much about voting and there were local elections that were happening that I could contribute to,” Cummings said. “It was frustrating to watch it happen to be powerless.” 
Part of her job in these clubs was to organize assemblies to educate the student body on how to pre-register and research candidates in the election.<br />
“In high school, if it wasn’t for the presentations we gave, nobody would know what they were doing,” she said. 
Through their media prevalence, one of Cumming’s clubs, Vote-16, got the local City Council members to have a real conversation with them. They were making a change through their relentless push to be heard.
There is an issue, however, with getting young people who have registered to vote to turn out in the elections. The combination of these two strides, registration and voter turnout, are essential to getting first-time voters to the polls.</p>

<p>For both Cummings and O’Donnell this was the first election they could vote in. And both come from states with an established system of mail in voting.<br />
O’Donnell, who’s from Washington, voted with ease from DC.<br />
“Washington has pure play mail in voting. Everybody votes by mail,” O’Donnell said.<br />
However, Cummings, who’s from California, failed to submit an absentee ballot. 
“It’s very interesting being from California because we joke about how our votes don’t really matter,” she said. “I think growing up and hearing that all the time made me have less priority in making sure I voted.” 
Even those who helped others learn to vote lacked the information to submit an absentee ballot. Though the political messaging in the state was a factor. 
Behind the scenes, the process of registration and voting stretches weeks after the official election day. In the Arlington County election office, Chairman of the Electoral Board Kimberly Phillip gave insight to the most recent election. 
“Arlington is not thought of as a university town, but we have a number of universities here and universities that have dorms here,” Phillip said.<br />
Voting by mail has been an option for Virginia voters for years, though ballot drop boxes were introduced to help with the overflow of mail-in ballots in 2020. In Arlington, it is primarily older voters that are voting by mail and young voters who vote day of the election.<br />
“Typically, we don’t see a huge percentage of young voters, like university students, who are voting absentee by mail,” Phillip said. 
This was the first year the county had done same day voter registration, those who had missed the registration deadline could go in-person to the polling stations and register on the day of the election. Over 2,000 people did same day registration, with young voters making up the largest portion.<br />
“They [young voters] knew that they were not registered to vote in Virginia, but they knew that they had an opportunity to register and to be able to vote the same day,” Phillip said.<br />
Phillip noted how the election process is constantly changing. In 2020 it was the addition of drop boxes, in 2022 it was same day voter registration.<br />
“Every year when something new comes down from the General Assembly, it changes our data,” she said. “And I don’t think that we’re expecting to see it down to a downtick in same day registrations in the 18-to-24-year old’s anytime soon.” 
In this landscape, it is important to keep people informed of all the ways they can vote. Arlington County provides voter information on their website and Twitter page. Even at this level of government that is focused solely on voting, social media is becoming influential in their operation.<br />
“We’re not entirely sure how effective our reach is, with our own social media account, it’s the account that people go tend to go to when there’s a problem at a voting precinct,” Phillip said. “I know, that’s something that we’re going to be visiting this coming year.” 
The education of voters remains crucial as even in the next election changes are going to be made to the voting process. Recently, the county board has approved ranked choice voting for local elections.<br />
“We’ll be depending a lot on Twitter, on our website, and on going out and talking to people and organizations about how [ranked choice voting] works,” Phillip said. 
Political parties are constantly working to further their voter base. Marketing their platform to people from all backgrounds. All that effort is for nothing if they can’t get people out to vote.</p>

<p>Young voters have the lowest turnout of any age group, but recently have shown the most growth with an almost 90% increase in voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections from the previous midterm. 
They are an essential and growing target demographic for the political landscape.</p>
