I"‡"<p>Rebekah Vensel‚Äôs diet has changed significantly since moving out of her family home in south-central Pennsylvania into an apartment in Washington, D.C. The 24-year-old philanthropy manager now rarely purchases meat and fruit, and she has completely scratched bread from her shopping list.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI just know I can‚Äôt go through it,‚Äù said Vensel, referring to her struggle to consume these products by herself before they begin to rot.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-food-packaging">The Problem with Food Packaging</h2>

<p>In three of the district‚Äôs most popular grocery stores by market share, Giant, Safeway and Walmart, many fresh produce and meat items come in containers too large to be reasonably consumed by one person before the food diminishes in quality, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food Marketing Institute.</p>

<p>Beyond the matter of consuming food within its shelf life, smaller packages are priced higher than items packaged in bulk, creating an added financial burden for shoppers with only one mouth to feed.</p>

<p>Although some produce, such as apples, bananas and peppers can be purchased by their smallest natural unit, other items, such as berries, are packaged in a minimum quantity greater than the size of Mother Nature‚Äôs single unit. Rarely can a shopper choose to buy the exact number of strawberries that will fit their needs. Similarly, while a shopper might be able to purchase a single filet of fish from the seafood counter, they are less likely to find a counter that sells individual chicken breasts.</p>

<p>One-person households face the consequences of this structure, where the shelf life of food items is shorter than the average time it takes a single person to consume the smallest quantity offered by their grocery store.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US1150000-washington-dc/#households">census data</a>, nearly half of Washington, D.C.‚Äôs nonfamily households are made up of people living alone. These households, along with college students that reside in the district for most of the year, mean that people cooking for one constitute a significant portion of the region‚Äôs population.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-too-much-food">Consequences of Too Much Food</h2>

<p>Looking at fruits, vegetables and meat products typically sold in pre-packaged quantities, several items stand out as being more difficult to consume in full within the product‚Äôs shelf life without freezing them. Data reveals that this is especially true for meat products and certain fruits.</p>

<p>This barrier comes at a cost. Consumers who struggle to get through fresh foods quickly enough sacrifice diversity on their plates.</p>

<p>When she buys fresh vegetables, Vensel often chooses one type to sustain her between trips to the grocery store. While she can usually manage to consume one vegetable during its shelf life, purchasing and cooking a variety of produce throughout the week often leads to waste.</p>

<p>According to Allison Tepper, a registered dietitian in the Washington, D.C. region, diversifying the fruits and vegetables on the dinner plate is important. ‚ÄúEach color offers different nutrients,‚Äù she said. In extreme cases, ‚Äúpeople find that if they eat the same thing over and over for years and years, they can become intolerant to it or start to get reactions to certain foods.‚Äù</p>

<p>In addition to putting one-person households at a nutritional disadvantage, the current structure of food packaging contributes to the global issue of food waste. Any food that is not consumed before it begins to rot must either be composted or thrown away.</p>

<p>Even before reaching the refrigerators of consumers, growing food requires large plots of land and resources, according to Cassie Rodrigue, a climate activist and executive board member of American University‚Äôs Zero Waste club.</p>

<p>Rodrigue, a second-year undergraduate student studying political science and sustainability, says that about one-third of food grown worldwide is wasted. She warns that although many foods can be composted, individuals must properly sort their food waste for it to undergo the process. If food waste is thrown into regular trash cans, it goes straight to the landfill. Every addition to the landfill contributes to the release of more methane, which Rodrigue says is ‚Äúeven more potent than carbon dioxide emissions.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="financial-inequity">Financial Inequity</h2>

<p>The way traditional grocery stores package fresh produce and meat strains not only the environment, but also the wallets of shoppers who purchase the smallest available package. The price per ounce of smaller packages is almost always more than that of larger containers. On average, the smallest package is 31% more expensive than the largest package. In other words, one-person households are paying more for their groceries.</p>

<p>When she is craving something that she no longer buys from grocery stores, Vensel will opt for individually packaged items on occasion. But even when it is available, Vensel recognizes that single packaging is not always a good compromise.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSometimes I feel that it‚Äôs worse than the big packaging. It‚Äôs more money, and it‚Äôs not as good for the environment,‚Äù she said, noting that increased plastic waste results from individually wrapped items.</p>

<p>Rodrigue agrees. ‚ÄúSingle packaging kind of drives me crazy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I love farmer‚Äôs markets. You can bring your own bags.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="new-systems">New Systems</h2>

<p>Solutions to the food waste and financial inequity that result from grocery store trips as a single shopper are complex. Rodrigue says the first step is rooted in an old childhood rhyme.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe all know the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut the fourth R is Refuse. Refuse things you don‚Äôt need to be consuming in the first place.‚Äù</p>

<p>Can this be achieved through a self-serve structure in grocery stores that more closely resembles farmer‚Äôs markets? Vensel recalled attending markets where consumers bring their own container, fill it from a large bin of rice and pay by its weight. This same system could potentially be incorporated into traditional grocery stores for smaller produce items like berries.</p>

<p>However, Vensel warns that the solution is much more complicated than building self-serve produce stands. ‚ÄúStuff like [berries] are not always in season,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo, it has to be packaged in a certain way to get from one place to another.‚Äù</p>

<p>Changing the structure of how foods are packaged in grocery stores requires thinking on a larger scale, including reexamining the process that gets the food onto local shelves in the first place.</p>
