Thirteen years ago, Heather Burner was working a nursing shift at a busy hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. A fifteen year old girl with abdominal pain came in and was placed in a waiting room until a doctor could see her. She went into a bathroom and then left the hospital before being assessed.


A housekeeper entered the bathroom ten minutes later and found a newborn boy in the trash can. The girl, who turned out to be pregnant, had delivered her baby in secret, placed him in the trash can, and fled. 


Burner’s team was unsuccessful in saving the child’s life. 


This experience motivated Burner to start spreading awareness about Safe Haven laws, which allow parents to voluntarily, anonymously, and safely relinquish their children to authorities as an alternative to abandonment. The laws differ from state to state in regards to how old the infant can be and where they can be relinquished, but all fifty states and the District of Columbia now have Safe Haven laws. 


Burner is now the Executive Director of the [National Safe Haven Alliance](https://www.nationalsafehavenalliance.org/), an organization that aims to decrease infant abandonment rates in the U.S. and internationally. One of NSHA’s initiatives is state-by-state data collection and organization of infant relinquishments and abandonments. This work was started by NSHA board member Dawn Geras in the early 2000s.


“When I came on in 2017, working with Dawn, we actually tried to help her by contacting all the state Departments of Child and Family Services, and the Department of Health so we could assist her with those numbers,” Burner said.

The map above shows the average change in infant abandonment rates in each state since a state law has been passed. The more pink the state, the more effective its Safe Haven laws have been in decreasing infant abandonment. Green signifies a state where Safe Haven laws have been less effective. 


Nationally speaking, more than four fewer babies a year have been abandoned since the majority of states have instituted their Safe Haven laws, even with an additional 50 million American babies being born since then. Also, 4,688 legal relinquishments have happened since the first Safe Haven law was passed in Texas in 1999.


## California and Illinois: Safe Haven triumphs
Looking at specific states where abandonment has decreased helps to see patterns of why those state’s laws are more effective. One such state is California.


<iframe title="Infant abandonment in California since Safe Haven legislation was passed" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Rw8tZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Rw8tZ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

This graph shows yearly abandonment rates in California since their Safe Haven law was implemented in 2001. California has the largest decline in infant abandonment rates nationwide. Nearly one fewer baby has been abandoned every year, and over eleven-hundred infants have been relinquished since then.


California also has the lowest infant death rate at just under four deaths per 100,000 births, says the CDC’s 2022 National Vital Statistics Report on infant mortality in the United States. 


[Dr. Micah Orliss](https://www.chla.org/profile/micah-orliss-phd) is a psychologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at University of Southern California. Several of his patients have been relinquished under California’s Safe Haven law. He’s also done Safe Haven research in Los Angeles County.


Through his experience, Orliss has gathered insight on why California’s law works so well. He discussed the state’s awareness campaigns for Safe Haven laws, including bumper stickers on police cars, radio announcements, and news releases. 


He also highlighted the importance of good Safe Haven leadership. “Just because there's a law on the books doesn't mean anybody has to do anything with it,” Orliss said. “Having people who champion the program, really, really makes a difference.”


He mentioned Don Knabe, a former state county supervisor who worked on spreading awareness about Safe Haven while in office. Orliss said strong Safe Haven leaders like Knabe are one reason why California’s laws are so effective. 


Burner mentioned that California has Safe Surrender Clinics, where women can relinquish their babies right at the hospital when they give birth rather than bringing them home and risking the safety of a child they don’t wish to keep. Other states don’t allow this type of relinquishment. 


“For 2023 we really start to encourage states to modify the laws to allow a woman to surrender in the hospital, where the baby and the mother are the safest,” Burner said.


Illinois is similar to California overall, with the third-most effective Safe Haven laws in the country. In Illinois, one fewer baby has been abandoned every three years since the Safe Haven law was instituted here in 2001. Additionally, 151 relinquishments have happened in Illinois over this time period.


Geras, NSHA’s data collector, is also the Executive Chairperson for Illinois’s [Save Abandoned Babies Foundation](https://saveabandonedbabies.org/). She explained the importance SAB’s connections with different organizations and agencies have in strengthening the laws. 


For example, while writing Illinois’s Safe Haven law with a group of colleagues over twenty years ago, Geras formed a relationship with the [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services](https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/Pages/default.aspx). 


“Once the law was passed, we maintained that relationship, and I do believe we are the only state in the country that maintains such a close cooperative, working open relationship [with DCFS],” she said.


SAB has also developed a relationship with the Chicago Fire Department and Chicago Police Department. In past years, a member of each department has served as a board member for the foundation. This partnership is important because fire departments and police stations are two of the places where the Illinois Safe Haven law allows a baby to be relinquished. 


## Solutions
Despite triumphant states like California and Illinois, among several others, infant abandonment still happens daily in America. To further decrease abandonment rates and make Safe Haven laws more effective, there are a few initiatives to be accomplished.


“Awareness, awareness, awareness is our mantra,” Geras said. She explained that the more people know about the law, the more people will use the law instead of resorting to abandonment. This means increased training for Safe Haven personnel has to happen in addition to boosting awareness throughout the general public.


Increasing funding for Safe Haven initiatives is another solution. In Illinois, Geras estimates that each live abandoned baby costs the state $175,000 in administrative costs, foster care costs, police investigation costs, and incarceration costs. This doesn’t include the costs for any medical care the baby might need. 


She uses this metric to argue that it’s in the state’s favor to give them money, something the organization has long been fighting for. 


There are also plans for a national Safe Haven bill. “What we are hoping is to establish a federal Safe Haven law so that there would be basic templates and requirements for every state, so that they would be the same,” Burner said. 


She explained that this would provide federal oversight for infant relinquishment, and also level the playing field across the country. For instance, the federal law could mandate that a relinquished infant can be up to 30 days old, and states would have to abide by that while being able to add their own amendments at the state level.


As for the likelihood of this potential bill becoming law, Burner said, “This is a good time for us to have this discussion because there's a lot going on in our world with Roe v. Wade with a lot of different changes.” She’s referencing the Supreme Court’s recent overturning of Roe v. Wade, allowing states to limit or ban abortion. 


“We sit in a very unique position of supporting parents in crisis without having to say or push pro life or pro choice agendas,” she said. “When we look at that, it really helps us establish bipartisan support. Because no one wants to see a baby in a dumpster.”


## Safe Haven and Roe v. Wade
Burner brings up an important point here. As many states across the country have changed or are in the process of changing their abortion laws, Safe Haven laws could become an even more valuable resource for new parents with nowhere to turn. 


The Guttmacher Institute publishes [decennial data](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/attachments/hostile_supportive_states_updated_12-30-2020_as_of_date.pdf) about state-by-state abortion regulations and numerically rates each state on its hostility or support of abortions. When this data is joined with the NSHA data, a correlation can be seen between the effectiveness of Safe Haven laws and the presence of supportive abortion legislation.


The more pro-abortion legislation a state has, the more effective its Safe Haven laws tend to be. 


<iframe title="Hostility of state abortion laws compared with effectiveness of state Safe Haven laws" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-Heo2V" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Heo2V/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

The abortion law data is from 2020, before Roe v. Wade was overturned and states could institute more hostile laws. States are still continuing to change their laws since the June overturning.


Given that states with more hostile abortion laws tend to have less effective Safe Haven laws, Safe Haven relinquishment and abandonment figures may begin to shift once new abortion legislation takes effect. If they follow the existing trend, abandonments could rise. 


This is when experts agree awareness becomes crucial. As more and more women are unable to get abortions in several states around the country, they could turn to abandoning their child if they feel they have no other option. 


Geras says, “If anybody is listening, if anybody is reading this, you can help. Talk about it. Tell a friend. You might save a life.”
