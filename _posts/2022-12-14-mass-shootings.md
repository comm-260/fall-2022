The [recently reduced prison sentencing](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/nikolas-cruz-life-sentence-verdict-reaction-beyond-disgusting-one-relative-of-slain-victim-says/) based on “mental illness” for Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has further established the misconception that mental health disorders are the sole cause of mass shootings. 
In reality, over 30% of mass shooters display no signs of mental illness. 
Cruz’s defense team described him as a [“broken, brain-damaged, mentally ill young man”](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/courts/2022/10/11/parkland-shooter-nikolas-cruz-trial-closing-arguments-deliberations-could-today/8234921001/) who was doomed from the start because his birth mother used drugs and alcohol while pregnant. 
They asserted that since Cruz is a victim of severe mental illness, he could not have been in full control of his actions when he murdered his peers in 2019. However, evidence confirmed that the systematic nature of Cruz’s actions was calculated and purposeful. 
“I do not consider it ethical to manipulate the system by utilizing a term such as ‘mental illness’ to dismiss mass murder,” said Kathy Daisy, a mental health counselor. “By doing this, you are able to essentially excuse anyone of anything at any time.”
The vague rhetoric of this trial unfairly links all people struggling with mental illness to violent mass shooters like Cruz in the eyes of the public. 
“Committing acts of harm, on a mass scale or individually, is not the sign of an illness,” said American University psychology professor, Dr. Tanja Aho. “We need to interrogate how the underlying systems allow for such violence to happen in the first place.” 
A [Columbia University study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.15161?af=R) led by Ragy Girgis, MD concluded that severe mental illness (psychosis) was absent in the majority of mass shooting perpetrators. 
More specifically, the researchers found that only 8% of mass shooters presented a severe mental illness that would have been a large contributing factor to such a violent act. They caution that pinning the cause of mass shootings on mental health disorders is incorrect and unnecessarily stigmatizing. 
Mass shootings are typically caused by a complex combination of factors that vary by the individual. 
Employment trouble, substance abuse, and ownership of a legally obtained weapon are the most common parts of a mass shooter’s background and personal history.

You hear of kids shooting up a school and later come to find out that he was bullied and angry at those who treated him horribly,” Daisy said. “At what level is this misguided vengeance rather than mental illness, or am I to believe that the bullied kid who retaliates has got to be mentally unstable? Without context, how can someone really even attempt to categorize someone as ‘mentally unstable?’”
As the media continues to throw around the term “mentally ill” with no clinical information about what it even means, individuals struggling with mental health disorders will also continue to be alienated by society. 
“Mentally disabled people are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators,” Aho said. “We have a long history of demonizing these people as ‘other’ and using them as stereotypes in our narratives.”
In fact, a [study](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014#t2n2) conducted by The American Journal of Psychology found that after test subjects were shown news stories about mass shootings, 56% of the respondents said they were unwilling to work closely with a mentally ill person. 40% of the subjects admitted they thought people with serious mental illness are more dangerous than the general population. 
This is caused by the media dramatization of blaming mental illness as the prevalent cause of shootings because it is easier than addressing the societal factors that contribute to violence.

“Mental illness remains the scapegoat for mass shootings and other forms of harm because if we gave up the excuse of mental illness, we would have to face what actually unites most of these perpetrators: that they are white, cis men,” said Aho. 
A famous example is [Donald Trump’s statement](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-claims-experts-mental-illness-mass-shootings/story?id=65101823) after the El Paso, Texas shooting in 2019: “Mental illness and hatred pull the trigger, not the gun,” said the former president. “I want guns in the hands of people that are mentally stable. People that are insane, people that are sick up here (in the brain); I don’t want them to get a gun.”
Mental health experts typically disagree with the term “mentally unstable,” for it generalizes a myriad of unique and complex types of mental health disorders under a single attribute. 
“Using the label of ‘mentally unstable’ is horrible,” said Daisy. “This is something that then translates into anyone who has ever had a mental health diagnosis, which is a very slippery slope.”
These harmful depictions of mentally ill individuals are even more common in entertainment media. Severe mental health disorders are used as shock value devices to scare viewers. 
A classic example is any version of The Joker from DC Comics. Joker is violent and evil because he is “crazy.” 
Most notably, actor [Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/) portrayal features the famous “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him” line, followed by Joker shooting a talk show host. 
This scene conveys the false message that mentally ill people will retaliate with violence if you upset them. 
“I feel bad for how my classmates with more serious mental disorders have been impacted by all the school shooting news,” said high school senior Sophia Weiss. “I feel like it’s an unspoken thing that people are more cautious around them, even though they are not violent people.”
In addition, news media stories are more likely to mention interpersonal violence than suicide even though research shows that suicide is far more related to mental illness than violence is. The incongruence in which topics are covered in the media does not provide an accurate portrayal of the real world.

“The media further stigmatizes people with mental health disorders, which can lead to legislation and discriminatory laws that harm them,” Aho said. “I don’t think the mental health status of perpetrators belongs in news reports at all.”
