Jalah Scott spent almost every weekend of her childhood in Downtown Brooklyn, New York. Every weekend after basketball practice at the Dodge YMCA on Atlantic Ave. her mother would take her to the Brooklyn Borough Hall Greenmarket to restock the house with fresh organic produce. 
“I loved that farmers market but my very frugal mother loved it more.” Said Scott. “There was nothing like it near our home in East Flatbush and for a long time I thought that was the only farmers market in the city. Nowhere else could we get organic fruits and vegetables that didn’t have to get shipped across the country or cost an arm and a leg. It was completely worth commuting the 45 minutes back home lugging around huge tote bags full of food if we could save some money.”
A young Scott would be surprised to learn that New York is actually home to over 100 different. The reason that Scott and countless other New Yorkers are forced to commute to their not so local farmers markets is yet another side-effect of the racial inequality of the city. This is because there are about double the amount of farmers markets in majority white neighborhoods than there are in majority Black neighborhoods. Black low income New York residents have a harder time finding fresh organic produce from the many local growers in and around the city because there are far fewer farmers markets in areas that are majority Black.

## Ethnic History of Farmers Markets in New York

Until the mid 20th century markets were the essential part of living in New York City. New York’s ports were a world-class hub for the movement of people and products and as such there was a huge market for farmers to sell their produce. 
“From the start it was actually the heavy presence of ethnic and cultural minorities that drove the produce cultivation and consumption that allowed markets to grow the way they did in the city” Says Carol Durst-Wertheim, the president of the board of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County and author of “History of the Food Markets of NYC”. Because of the etnic ties associated with them, markets took on a much more important role than merely providing for the people of New York. These markets became a source of common  interest for the minority groups who were running and purchasing from them.

Annually, New York State collects data on farmers and community farmers markets for the Department of Agriculture and Markets. The department collects information on the location, contact information, hours of operation, seasons of operation and the different government aid types that are accepted at the markets. 
Using the data from the Department of Agriculture and Markets in conjunction with census information on the racial makeup of the over 2,000 census tracts in New York City we can paint a picture of the types of neighborhoods that are home to a majority of the farmers markets. These maps show that there is a high concentration of farmers markets in neighborhoods that have a majority white population, especially concentrated in and lower manhattan a part of the city that has a very high cost of living.
