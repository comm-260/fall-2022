Reports from the U.S. Department of State show that over the past decade, intercountry adoptions have decreased about 85%.

"The orphanage that I lived in was really awful," Lauren Padua, a Chinese adoptee said. "I actually had living relatives still, but none of them wanted to or was capable of taking me in. The orphanage was really small, it was very rundown. I distinctly remember one of the women who worked throwing a pot of boiling water at me, so coming to America to this very generous, very welcome, very large family-it was definitely shocking." 

Lauren Padua is a 26-year-old woman who was adopted from China when she was 16. She currently works at a restaurant in Milford, Connecticut and is a newlywed. For the past decade, she has been living with her adoptive parents and two younger siblings who were adopted from China, as well. They were adopted at a younger age and before she entered the household. 

Reports from the U.S. Department of State show that over the past decade, intercountry adoptions have decreased about 85%. Intercountry adoptions are adoptions that occur between two or more countries.

Adoptions within the US have also decreased about 45% from 2019 to 2020, according to State Department Official Christy Buzzard. 

The data from the Bureau of Consular Affairs also focuses on international adoptions entering the United States. In 2020, the top three states in the US that received the most international adoptees per capita of one million people are Wyoming, Alabama, and Washington, DC.

While the decrease in adoptions both within the United States and internationally began before the COVID-19 pandemic, Buzzard largely attributes the 45% decrease in the US to the pandemic. Because of the pandemic, global travel restrictions were imposed and global operations were disrupted, from food supply to adoptions. 

According to Buzzard, "COVID-19 pandemic related closures and capacity limitations in court and government offices in countries of origin made it increasingly difficult, and often impossible, for families to file paperwork and obtain official documents required to complete an adoption."

In normal circumstances, adoption paperwork is complicated and extensive. The *Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption* is the treaty that governs these adoptions, and more than 100 countries are part of it. The process to adopt a child ranges on average from a year to four years. This process laid out by the Hague Convention has many steps, including obtaining a home study, completing many forms, and waiting unknown periods of time for government agencies to review the paperwork.

With the added constraint of COVID-19, adoptions have been severely delayed. In some countries, like China, they even suspended intercountry adoptions. Before the pandemic, countries like Russia (in 2014), Guatemala (in 2008), and Ethiopia (in 2018) have banned intercountry adoptions altogether, prioritizing domestic placements instead.

Despite this ban, data recorded by the Bureau of Consular Affairs on intercountry adoptions shows that Ethiopia is still in the top three countries in the world with the most international adoptions from 2010 to 2020. It is sandwiched between China and South Korea.

The data reported seems to show inconsistencies with some countries' policies on adoptions. Countries like Kazakhstan, Vietnam, and the ones previously mentioned have had periods of intercountry adoption bans, or bans from certain countries. The statistics also do not count for illegal adoptions. 

Since adoptions are largely handled by agencies and the adoptive parents, most children are just told by workers at the orphanage what is happening. For Padua, the adoption agency told the adoptive parents that she was 13 years old when she was really 16. They even sent photos of her from when she was 13. She was thankful that her parents still wanted to adopt her. She is also thankful that she was able to build a relationship with her new family and bring Chinese culture to her younger siblings. 

"I think my siblings and my cousins when they were younger, my families used to try to keep them connected to the roots with their adopted siblings, which is the children they are adopted with, but obviously, they didn't personally know the culture, really at all," Padua said. "So it wasn't really until I got there and until I kind of embraced the family that I reintroduced their culture."

Padua has struggled with adjusting to her new life here, though. It was extremely difficult when she first got to America. She spent the first year of her life communicating through a small device that would translate from Chinese to English. She gradually learned the language from her parents and with the help of ESL (English as a Second Language) classes. She is also thankful that she was able to bond with her siblings. It was difficult bonding with the youngest sibling, Dylan, but she was able to connect with Ren, who wanted to have an older sister. 

But not all adoption experiences are like Padua's. Her best friend, Kerrigan, was also adopted around the same time she was. While she remembers it being helpful to compare experiences with her, Kerrigan's relationship with her single mother was not as close as Padua's was to her family.

"They have a pretty complicated relationship, so there was a period of time we had stopped talking to each other because I simply had a really good American life, and she was really struggling and needed a lot more support than I could give her," Padua recalled. 

Nowadays, they are closer than ever. Kerrigan was even Padua's Maid of Honor at her wedding. 

"I'm mostly really grateful for my parents and the opportunities that they've given me," Padua said when reflecting on her life now. "My life in America is a lot more successful than it could have been in China."
