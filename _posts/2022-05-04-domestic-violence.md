Incidents of domestic violence have increased globally during COVID-19.

"I was threatened so many times by my abuser. One time I can clearly remember like it was five minutes ago was when he almost killed me [by strangulation] because I wouldn't have sex with him. I have had my windows busted out of my home and my car. I was almost killed three times by my abuser who, by the way, is the father of my two kids (eight and 19 years old). I have been spit on, strangled [until] blood clots came [out] my eyes, and the mental abuse was horrific," said Delita S, a survivor of domestic violence during the Shadow Pandemic in Washington, DC. 

The Shadow Pandemic is the term coined for the rapid increase in domestic violence cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidents of domestic violence have increased globally during COVID-19, according to the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. House of Ruth (a domestic violence shelter in DC) president Sandra Jackson states that the consequences imposed by COVID-19, such as the stay-at-home mandate, only increased exhibiting tensions between couples living together. 

"Covid has affected relationships because you get locked in place too long, and while the abuse gets worse, you can't get out," said Delita S. 

Delita escaped her abuser and received help through Domestic Violence Wears Many Tags (DVWMT), also known as "The School for Domestic Violence." DVWMT is an educational organization in Washington D.C. established in 2008. 

Afi Gaston, the organization's founder, had a 19-year-old daughter, Anaiona Gaston, who was a victim of domestic violence. Anaiona was shot in the head by her boyfriend in 2016 while holding their two-month-old infant in her arms. Today, her mother sets out to help survivors escape their abusers, as well as educate men and women on effective solutions to domestic violence.
	
"The resources and support are not consistent. Domestic violence is a very delicate issue and programs, support, and resources are expected to be in place. When that doesn't happen, victims get discouraged to report," said Gaston.

Nineteen nonprofit organizations in Washington D.C. lend aid to domestic violence survivors through housing programs and other social services. DC Safe is the only 24/7 domestic violence crisis center in Washington. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, DC Safe's client base has increased by 57%. According to their website, "71% out of 4,115 clients screened through our Lethality Assessment Program in 2021 were assessed as high-risk for re-assault or homicide." 
	
Additionally, DC Safe reports that injuries in these cases appear to have gotten more severe, and there have been 11 domestic violence homicides in 2021 thus far.

According to DC Safe, 79,652 calls were made to their crisis response line from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. This is a vast uptick compared to the 12,196 clients referred in 2017 and 12,958 calls made in 2019. 

Toshira Monroe, Deputy Director of My Sister's Place DC, said that not only has COVID-19 making abusers more tense, but it's also taken away options from survivors.
	
"There are a lot of financial constraints," said Monroe. "Removing someone from your life who is contributing in a bad way may also be contributing something helpful. Survivors may not cooperate with prosecution or want to be witnesses. Sometimes they have no choice and are compelled by court, but sometimes they won't pick up the phone when we call." 
	
However, both shelters for victims of intimate partner violence and police forces experienced a significant decrease in call volume at the start of 2020, resulting in a massive misrepresentation of statistics. According to City of Alexandria Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault Division Chief Debra Evans, the city saw a decline in requests for services in the beginning of the pandemic. She also stated that incidents of abuse seem to be more severe.
	
According to Monroe, the number of reported domestic violence cases against children also declined. But that does not tell the whole story.
	
"Children's reports decreased dramatically because they are not at school, where teachers and other faculty are usually the ones to report it," said Monroe. "Violence in the home is just not reported as much."

The Metropolitan Police Department stated that all violent crimes in the past two years have increased by 148 cases as of April 11, 2022. The MPD does not include statistics from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program and IncidentÐBased Reporting System governed by the FBI, and therefore does not guarantee the most accurate statistics.
	
"We saw an increase in clients looking for transitional housing instead of shelter, but otherwise, our numbers have stayed pretty steady and are similar to our report in 2021," said Monroe. "The majority of clients need long-term support but because of COVID, not a congregate setting such as a shelter. Most see that shelter is fine because they have their own rooms, and the city puts a lot of funding out to help clients get to housing. But, there is a shortage of affordable housing in D.C."
	
My Sister's Place DC is a domestic violence hotline and shelter in Washington, DC. In 2021, My Sister's Place provided 1247 case management and counseling sessions, provided 110 survivors with safe housing, and served 160 adult and 285 child survivors. Like other shelters in Washington, including House of Ruth, the number of survivors seeking help increased, but only minimally.
	
A report from the National Commission on Covid and Criminal Justice (NCCCJ) attempted to estimate the number of domestic violence victims during the pandemic by pulling their evidence from police calls, emergency hotline registries, and health records across 18 studies globally and 12 in the United States. Across the United States, domestic violence is proven to have increased by 9.7% in March and April of 2020 Ð an estimated 1,330 more domestic violence calls for service per day across the U.S. during that time period Ð and overall 8.1% after stay-at-home orders were in place. 
	
Different shelters and police departments have differing statistics for domestic violence cases during the pandemic. There are several factors for why the data cannot be closely tracked. Organizations like the NCCCJ attempted to collect data from police, health, and other administrative records, but according to a comprehensive study from February 2021, it is impossible to totally measure domestic violence during or after the pandemic. 
	
According to Monroe, jail time does not always make survivors feel protected from their abusers.
	
"Some clients have had abusers released after four years in prison come and start a fire or try to hurt them," said Monroe. "The deterrent for abuse is that when police come, they may feel like the danger is finished but find out that it's not."

Additionally, the historical relationship between police and domestic violence victims and people of color is heavily strained, and Monroe states that we will never know exactly how many calls are not made out of fear of how the police will respond.

Delita detailed how she felt let down by the criminal justice system during her recent escape from domestic violence. 
	
"During the pandemic, I was being stalked and being threatened to be killed by my abuser," said Delita. "I was afraid and felt failed by the judicial system, my kids and I. Because every time he was locked up for trying to find me and kill me, the judicial system let him right back out. Many, many times, while he was locked up, was during Covid. I was very scared. My kids and I and the rest of my family had to relocate to a whole new residence because of my abuser."
	
Monroe stated that the lack of trust some survivors have in police is a matter of weighing the pros and cons of turning in their abusers. 
	
"The majority of clients we serve are people of color, and there's not a lot of trust in law enforcement," said Monroe. "Immigrant populations have police from their home countries who are not on the up and up, and they don't know what our police systems will do. You stick with the devil you know. You know your abuser but not what police will do. Will they get deported? What about sponsorship? Will they be separated from their US born children? They're just not familiar with how US systems work."

Gaston, who works closely with survivors of domestic violence in group classes and seminars, stated that many of her clients feel unfaithful about law enforcement.

"Fear or no trust of the criminal justice system could be one reason why victims do not report. Victims mention to me personally, Ôthe restraining order is just a piece of paper.' Which is true, it doesn't stop an abuser from tracking or stalking their victim," said Gaston.
	
Monroe stated that My Sister's Place places its trust in its clients above all else, and does not try to help them in ways the clients are uncomfortable with.

"The other piece is the level of violence Black and brown communities have experienced by police," said Monroe. "Some of these families make money the best way that they can, and don't want to get in trouble or have their children removed. Sometimes calling the police makes it worse for the victim or survivor, because there are abusers who couldn't care less about police. We trust that the survivor knows best and we listen. We don't always encourage law enforcement if the client says that it won't help."
