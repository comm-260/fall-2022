Three new road construction projects will cause major delays for travelers within Yellowstone National Park this summer.

The projects include the replacement of the Lewis River Bridge, repaving and reconstruction of the Grand Loop Road between Old Faithful and West Thumb, and replacement of the Yellowstone River Bridge. Each project is expected to cause an extra 30-minute delay on the road. The projects must be worked on between April and early November due to the extreme winter weather conditions that occur the rest of the year.
	
The road construction projects are likely in response to increased visitation, which is having major impacts on road conditions. It also addresses [deferred maintenance](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/infrastructure/deferred-maintenance.htm), which refers to repairs postponed over one year. Currently, paved roads and structures account for over 50% of deferred maintenance across the National Park System.

Historically, recreational visitors and traffic increase or decrease at about the same rate. This means that increasing visitation is impacting not just trails and lodging, but also road conditions and structures. As more traffic passes through the park each year, the quality and safety of roads and bridges will deteriorate faster. This is especially true for older infrastructure that has not been repaired or replaced in decades.

The rehabilitation of the Grand Loop Road between Old Faithful and West Thumb will have the largest impact on visitors this summer given its proximity to Old Faithful, one of the most famous thermal features in Yellowstone. The construction zone spans 22 miles and is described by [Yellowstone National Park](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/road-construction.htm) as “one of the most heavily traveled road corridors in the park.” In addition, the road is located between the West and South Entrances with the first and third highest amounts of traffic. The construction is expected to be completed in fall 2023, so visitor impacts will extend to next summer.

The replacement of the Lewis River Bridge will have the second greatest impact on visitors this summer due to its proximity to the South Entrance, which has the third-highest amount of traffic. The 273-foot-long bridge will be completely removed and replaced. However, the construction of a new bridge downstream will give visitors safe passage to and from the South Entrance. Project completion is predicted for fall 2023, so these travel delays will also extend to next summer.

Out of the three construction projects, the Yellowstone River Bridge will have the smallest impact on visitors this summer because it is closest to the Northeast Entrance, which has the lowest amount of traffic out of all the entrances; however, the replacement will have more significant long-term impacts because it is not expected to finish until fall 2025. Like the Lewis River Bridge, this 604-foot-long bridge will be completely replaced, and a temporary bridge upstream will provide safe passage in its place. 

Despite the major delays, Yellowstone National Park maintains that the positive long-term impacts of road construction projects outweigh the short-term inconvenience of longer travel times. In the most recent State of the Park report, they asserted that “Visitor experience and frustration ratings appeared to have little to no significant correlation with GPS-based average speeds across road segments in the park. Respondents were generally not frustrated, gave high experience ratings, and did not perceive major problems on roadways.” 

Major road construction projects have historically had other impacts on the visitor experience outside of travel times. In 2021, the major construction efforts from Tower-Roosevelt to Chittenden Road were finished. One of the losses during its construction was access to trails for Mount Washburn. Similarly, the trail to Lewis River Falls will be closed this summer. By the Yellowstone River Bridge, hiking trails will remain open; but the Yellowstone River Picnic Area and Wrecker Curve access road and parking area will be closed. No trails or sites are expected to close on the Grand Loop Road construction zone.

Decision-making about how and when to initiate road construction projects goes beyond just the National Park Service. In addition to considering environmental impacts, they also must consider the business implications for the hospitality and concessions companies operating within the park. Xanterra Travel Collection, the primary authorized concessioner in Yellowstone, manages lodging, dining, shopping, and recreational activities within the park. This business accounts for the vast majority of [visitor spending](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/socialscience/vse.htm) at Yellowstone, which in turn impacts the economic output. Rick Hoeninghausen, the director of sales for Yellowstone National Park Lodges, emphasized that decisions about road construction projects are made through a two-way communication process. He noted that “Discussions begin at the park service, but they quickly loop us in to coordinate and ask opinions on how construction will impact the business.” As a team, they must decide whether to close certain roads, and then come up with solutions in order to not cut off parts of the park. The potential impacts on visitors remain at the center of discussions for Xanterra Travel Collection, given that their business revolves around creating successful visitor experiences. 

All three road construction projects are funded by the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) and Legacy Restoration Fund (LRF). The GAOA passed in 2020 in an effort to address the deferred maintenance backlog. The bipartisan legislation was championed by conservation groups, especially the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). 

The [Northern Rockies Region of the NPCA](https://www.npca.org/regions/northern-rockies) note in their mission statement that “…in this recreation wonderland, they strive to balance visitor use with natural resource protection…” Road construction projects play a key role in that balance because they fix problems caused by visitor use and in the process protect natural resources from potential damage. For instance, the construction of guardrails, culverts, and other drainage structures on the Grand Loop Road will both increase visitor safety and protect the surrounding environment. The construction of new pullouts parking areas, alongside the Yellowstone River Bridge, will increase visitor access while simultaneously discouraging visitors from pulling off the road and parking in undesignated areas.

</script>

The National Park Service has refined their methodology for selecting deferred maintenance projects, taking a variety of databases and factors into consideration. John Garder, the Senior Director of Budget & Appropriations at NPCA, noted that the GAOA has elevated the importance of visitor and staff use of a facility or infrastructure in the project evaluation process. He commented that “The funding is more skewed to larger projects than we expected. The GAOA is their chance to get these projects done without having to do multi-year funding.” This explains the magnitude of the projects in Yellowstone National Park this summer, as both the size of the park and the high number of annual visitors make many of their projects big endeavors. 

The GAOA is a big step in providing funding for the National Park Service, but it will only address half of the backlog. The total National Park Service project list under the GAOA includes 48 projects total in 2021, 34 projects in 2022, and 27 proposed projects for 2023. The road construction projects occurring this summer were approved in 2021 or 2022, so the only project listed under 2023 is the rehabilitation of the Old Faithful Wastewater Collection and Treatment System. However, all three road construction projects will still be underway in 2023, so the traffic delays will remain despite the decreasing number of projects listed each year for funding.

Beyond the issues with deferred maintenance, there are also problems with loss of staff, increased visitation, and the threat of climate change. These issues all require government funding and planning to improve sustainability and conservation efforts, support staff, and fix infrastructure issues. Aside from the projects, Yellowstone will be celebrating its 150th anniversary this summer. In anticipation of the celebrations, the most recent [State of the Park report](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/management/upload/State-of-the-Park-Final-Pages.pdf) stated “This milestone is an important reminder of our continuing responsibility as national park leaders. While much has been accomplished, a considerable amount of work remains in front of us. We will continue making decisions that aim to protect the health of Yellowstone for centuries to come.”
