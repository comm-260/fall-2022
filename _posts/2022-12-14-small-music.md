Music is an essential part of life. It is the way that the early humans told lessons and plays at parties, weddings, funerals, and get-togethers. They are a way to connect with people, share those same stories from years ago, and showcase your talents. 

In the past, before record labels and technology, if you were a good singer, you would sing for your village at events and shows, but then came the production of records. Music became more widespread and popularized, and soon, people were obsessing about their favorite artists. New genres of music arose, especially in the early 1900s into the 1950s. Music became representative of someone’s political beliefs and cultural background and even helped create some of the subcultures we know today, such as Goths, Emo, Scene, and Punk. 

## SoundCloud and Spotify 
Starting a music career takes work. Besides needing talent, you need a following and money; those are challenging things to come by. You can use online sources to get your information out there if you have the necessary means and resources. 

SoundCloud is a music-streaming service where you can share music for free. Create an account, record, edit, convert it into an MP3, and upload it onto the site. In theory, this is easy. Do you have a talent and want to be recognized? Just upload your work, and you will become famous. But in practice? Getting your content to a broad audience involves strategy and advertising. 

Spotify is another music-sharing application and website. However, unlike SoundCloud, it is much larger and more corporate. To have your music on Spotify, you can upload it for a fee using different services, but if signed to a record label, all the legal and monetary work is done for you. 

Being a musician is difficult. You needed to be a producer, manager, and talent. When starting, it may just be you and a few friends. Most people fail; however, small creators who use SoundCloud often are not after the same fame and publicity as record-signed artists. Of course, everybody wants their talent to be appreciated, but small creators assemble a community with like-minded individuals. 

## Mumble Rap and Fandoms
SoundCloud introduced the space for a new style of rap called Mumble Rap. This new genre sparked a large population of new musicians with a very particular and niche sound. This sound is accompanied by a community of outcasts, causing these rappers and fans to connect. These communities are strong and tight-knit and will support their artists no matter what. 

I analyzed six artists: Lil’ Pump, Lil’ Peep, Juice Wrld, Lil’ Xan, Sofaygo, and Slum6ps. All of these artists fall under the genre of “SoundCloud Rap/Mumble Rap” and either got their start or have a large following on SoundCloud. Below are visualizations of their discography as of December 2022.

Fans of smaller creators often have a much deeper following than fans of more prominent creators. If you can hop on a Discord group chat with your artist and speak with them directly, you feel much more attached to the music than someone who comments on a well-known artist’s post and will never get a response.

## Data, Findings, and Even More Questions
The data I analyzed was from Spotify, SoundCloud, and YouTube. I looked at how many streams and followers each of the six artists I was looking at had and how many subscribers they had on YouTube. 

When comparing this data, I want to note that Spotify has over triple the number of SoundCloud users. As of writing, SoundCloud has approximately 70 million users, while Spotify has approximately 433 million. However, this shows the *concentration* of users who listen to an artist is much higher on SoundCloud than on Spotify. The artists on SoundCloud who started there and continued to share unreleased demos and connect with their audience have a deeper connection with the consumer. 

<iframe title="Total Followers on SoundCloud" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-za725" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/za725/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="209" data-external="1"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script>
<iframe title="Total Followers on Spotify " aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-MzpvN" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MzpvN/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="209" data-external="1"></iframe>< script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script>

I found the same pattern with this data as well. If the number of followers is larger on Spotify than on SoundCloud, what about the streams? Although Spotify does have more users, the streams of individual songs show that an artist who starts on a small application can move their audience to a larger one.

Can small creators branch out onto a more prominent platform? The data I found told me the answer is yes, they can. However, I began to think about why they would want to do that. 

John Simson has been the program director of the business and entertainment program at KOGOD School of Business at American University since 2013. In addition to that, he is the supervisor of the American University Record Label and was an established entertainment lawyer. I spoke with him to try and answer some of the questions I had. 

I also spoke with Matt Twiford, a Professorial Lecturer at American University in Audio Technology and current freelance audio engineer of over 15 years, to get some answers about an artist’s point of view. 

**What are today’s difficulties of becoming an artist today?** 

*John*: “When I was managing artists it was a very different time…we didn’t have a lot of these tools…if you wanted to make it you had to sign with one of the major record companies” It was much more challenging to find ways of getting an artist noticed. Radio and touring were the best ways to do that without being signed to a label. 

*Matt*: “The odds are incredibly stacked against you as an independent artist. Without being that cutting edge artist who has the charisma to draw [attention], how would you ever become big.”

**What is the biggest reason for an artist to start on SoundCloud instead of Spotify?**

*Matt*: In the 2010s, giving your track away for free was very common. No one is buying music everyone is illegally downloading this. I am giving my music away in the hope that it will get my name out there. “As an independent artist myself you want to put yourself as many places as possible.”

*Matt*: SoundCloud was all we had. Very community-based. That is how you meet other people. “I think SoundCloud is super easy. There is not as much pressure on artists… It’s a much easier way to do it. Just another way to get your name out there.”

*John*: There will always be those geniuses who have the force to break out of their small following to a larger group. “But once [you] break through, the lure of the record companies is hard to turn down.”

## YouTube 
How does YouTube relate to this? YouTube surpasses both Spotify and SoundCloud, with users coming in at about 2.29 billion people. For reference, there are about 7.8 billion people worldwide, meaning around a third of them have a YouTube account. The six artists I looked at had more subscribers on YouTube than any other streaming service.

## Conclusions
If you are a small creator looking to break into the music industry, do you have a chance to make a name for yourself? The answer is likely yes if you are determined and have a desirable talent. With new technologies such as TikTok, algorithms are picking what is popular and finding that sound across large and small creators. 

The data above backs up the claim that if you have a following on one application, you can transfer that following elsewhere. Music lovers will follow the sound and the artist, so if that is on SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube, or some other streaming platform, it does not make that large of a difference.
