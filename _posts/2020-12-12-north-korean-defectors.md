"After running and crawling in the mountainside for more than four hours, I was so exhausted that I even thought of killing myself with [the] rat poison I had in my pocket for emergency," Kim Kangyoo said as he played back what he remembered as the hardest moment of his life. 

For all North Korean defectors the journey is long, arduous, and agonizing.  "A number of coincidences helped my defection that day," Kim explained. Obstacles such as mines, hunger, dehydration, and of course being caught, are all factors that could lead to a fatal ending at an attempt at defecting. 

Each year over 1000 individuals defect from North Korea in hopes of finding their chance at living a free life. However, over the course of the past eight years fewer people have been able to escape the world's most secretive regime. 

Kim Jong Un has been able to maintain tighter control over the country in comparison to the past two regime leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. While it may appear on the surface that through Jingoistic state propaganda and increased national ideologies Kim Jong Un has been able to gain greater support and faith from his citizens; a more nuanced examination of the circumstances surrounding the regime reveals that the overall respect for the countries great leader has diminished and may be a factor as to why Kim Jong Un has placed greater efforts on stopping defections. 

When we date back to the years between 2008 and 2012 the average of about 2,400 defectos leaving annually. 2014 was the first noticeable drop in numbers where only about 1,396 defected.

Economics 

When looking back at history, the vast majority of defectors were motivated by economic hardships. Specifically the Great Famine which took place from 1994-1998 and resulted in an abundance of defectations during that time. But simply put, North Korea is not as poor as it used to be. While malnutrition is common, the imminent threat of starvation is no longer a concern for even the poorest in the country. 

"I left everything behind when I decided to escape from the North. I left family, home, my entire life. I left because I knew if I ever wanted to have a family I could not stay there. There, it is not living, it is surviving." says Chung Me who escaped from North Korea in 1959. He explained that at that time much of the country was starving and the fear of dying, hunger and deprivation is what drove him out of the country even though it meant leaving everyone he loved behind. 

During that time, the county's rulers were incessant about emphasizing that all means of production belonged to the people; the reality was that all means of production were owned by the party, and therefore the state. Since production was and still is monopolized by the "state power", it was also the "state power" who was responsible for the starvation of millions of people. According to the Organization Guidance Bureau official, more than 500 thousand people, including 50 party members, had starved to death in 1995. The following year, 1996, 1.5 million lives were lost due to hunger. 

At that time it was also most common for females and males between ages of 20 to late 30ﾃ不 to defect. Physically, they were the most well equipped demographic to endure the arduous journey and had the best chance at survival and beginning a new life once they reached asylum.

It is also important to note that there was less surveillance and border control at the time making defecting easier. With the countries increase in wealth the regime has been able to implement tighter border control, more fences, military personnel, and the government is no longer relying on simple brute force and surveillance. 

Propaganda

Throughout the duration of Kim Jung Unﾃ不 reign, he has been extremely successful at implementing an extensive propaganda campaign. The mention of defectors to North Korean citizens was only recently included in North Korean media and depicts South Korea as a "capitalist hell". 

North Korean media only releases stories of suffering refugees in the South and how they are unwelcome in the nation. North Korean elite Kim Young Ryong, who defected in 2007 from the Gyeonggi region, explains how even though South Korea is no longer depicted as "a poor and vile country" by the North, but suggests that although South Korea is a wealthy country, all refugees are discarded to the bottom of the social pyramid. Which is why in recent years, the unemployed demographic of North Korea has been seeing the greatest number of defectors, because even if they do go to the South to be at the bottom; at least they will have their freedom.

Double defectors also play an important role in the effectiveness in North Korean propaganda. When an individual double defects and returns to the North, they are broadcasted on national TV, dispatched on countrywide tours to speak first hand about the miserable life they endured in the South. 

Diplomatic Ties 

Internationally, North Korea is currently in a very advantageous position. Over the past few years Kim Jung Un has been able to establish greater global power for the regime and through that is further able to instil fear to not only North Korean citizens but to the rest of the world.  

Soo Kim, former CIA intelligence analyst and linguist specialist in North Korean policy explains how "North Korea is not going to back down especially with Kim being so close to getting what he wants".  

Seeing Kim Jong Un rise in power outside of the realm of just his country is enough to provoke an even greater fear in citizens which could deter defectors. Kimﾃ不 ability to manipulate other foreing governments to work in his favor further emphasizes the power he has and the power he has over his country. 
"Kim Jung Un is enjoying where alliances are at the moment. And currently, the united front that we are supposed to be seeing between Washington and the South is just not there" making it eleven more difficult to combat the regimeﾃ不 strength.  

From the North Korean perspective this is a very ideal situation because Kim has been very provocative in his rhetoric and missile tests that have not only allowed him greater access to global control, but has given him greater control over his country in comparison to the former regime leaders. And it is all driven primarily out of fear.
