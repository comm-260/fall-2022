A recent study ranked DC among the best in the country for youth mental health, but community activists paint a bleaker picture.

A [recent study](https://hopefulfutures.us/action) by the Hopeful Futures Campaign ranked D.C. third in the nation for tackling youth mental health issues. But as District schools emerge from the darkest stages of the pandemic, experts and community activists say they are seeing a degree of need that is not being captured in much of the data emerging right now.

Community activist and former teacher Lauren Grimes said that mental health services are critical to the young people she works with. 
 
"The students," she said, "really really need help - them and their families." 
 
Grimes, whose organization the Community Enrichment Project works with students from underserved communities in Wards 7 and 8, said that part of the problem is that there simply aren't enough mental health professionals in the building. 
 
"Social workers, they have these huge caseloads," Grimes said, "and they're not always able to reach the students the way they want to." 

Although the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) recommends that a single social worker or counselor should oversee [no more than 250 students]( https://www.schoolcounselor.org/About-School-Counseling/School-Counselor-Roles-Ratios), in D.C. social [workers oversee](https://hopefulfutures.us/action-dc/) an average of 365 students and counselors oversee 511 students. The only metric where D.C. overperformed was in terms of school psychologists, with a psychologist-to-student ratio of 1:410 - well under the recommended ratio of 1:500.

Over the pandemic, DC began to ramp up its mental health supports. Teachers and staff at many local education agencies (LEAs) were trained in how to [integrate socio-emotional learning]( https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/dc-voices-mental-health-services-for-students/) into school curriculums, and schools partnered with community-based organizations (CBOs) and the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) to establish more clinician positions in DC Schools. But as of [March 2022](https://dbh.dc.gov/node/1500291), 20 schools had DBH clinician vacancies and 69 had vacancies for CBO clinicians. 

In focus groups held by the DC Policy Center, [students shared](https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/state-of-dc-schools-20-21/) that it was challenging to connect virtually with mental health staff at their schools and find private spaces at home. 

But some students don't even make it that far. Grimes says that some students she works with aren't always even aware of the supports that are available to them or willing to access those resources when they are. She attributes this partially to poor communication on the part of the school, as well as the hesitancy of students to be fully open with people who are mandated reporters. 

Grimes and Kristi Matthews, a coordinator of the grassroots organization DC Girls Coalition, say this literal and functional lack of support is especially acute among DC's under-resourced students - like the youth they work with. 

Research has shown that [children who grow up]( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22183690/#:~:text=Results%3A%20For%20each%20SES%20indicator,disorders%20stronger%20than%20internalizing%20disorders.) in poor socioeconomic conditions are especially vulnerable to mental health issues.

Despite the District's efforts to ramp up mental health support and outreach, Matthews says that most of the resources were being directed toward children diagnosed prior to the pandemic - already a disproportionately wealthy and white demographic [given the socioeconomic barriers]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3011932/) to formal diagnosis. 

This "left a lot of our students who developed anxiety, depression, trauma within the pandemic in the lurch," Matthews said. 

Students designated as "at-risk" in D.C. schools are [supposed to get increased funds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/02/06/at-risk-funding-in-the-district-school-by-school/) for mental health, but those resources have a history of being diverted - up to and including the present year. The funding, which was first allocated by the D.C. Council in 2014, is supposed to provide added support to students considered to be at risk of academic failure, according to longtime financial analyst Mary Levy. 

This includes students who are homeless, qualify for welfare or food stamps or are more than a year behind in school. 

In this year alone, Levy said D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) illegally misspent millions of dollars of those funds on other services - something she has continued to testify about in front of various DC Council Committees. 

The idea, Levy said, was for the money to provide funds for after-school programs and services like attendance counselors and mental health professionals. They don't have to solely benefit at-risk children, she said, but they do need to be in the interests of those children. 
  
"The problem is that some schools hardly have to use any of their at-risk money to buy basic services," Levy said, "whereas others have to use a lot of their at-risk money for basic services." 
 
"Unfortunately that means the schools serving more students considered at-risk are more likely to see their funds misused," said Erin Roth, director of education research at the Office of the District of Columbia Auditor who co-wrote a [2019 report on the issue]( https://dcauditor.org/report/d-c-schools-shortchange-at-risk-students/). 
 
"You just can't really misspend [the funds] in wealthy schools because you don't have them," she said. 
  
Mental health, Roth said, was a key area where funds were misallocated. 
 
"Especially when we see these funds being misspent for mental health resources in schools," Roth said, "I think it's particularly unfair and harmful." The report found that DCPS misused nearly all of the at-risk funds budgeted for social workers and psychologists in high schools, and "dramatically underfunded high school social-emotional support positions."
 
Schools in the most need of counselors, according to the report, ended up getting the fewest. 

While Grimes and Matthews say that funding needs to be allocated more equitably towards existing at-risk students, they also think term should be expanded. Matthews says that the "at-risk" categorization itself is only able to capture some of the significant need present in D.C. There are students, she said "who they might not technically deem as at risk, who are 100% at risk" 

In 2021, the District of Columbia Public School System (DCPS) [reported that]( https://dcps.dc.gov/page/dcps-glance-enrollment) 42% of students in the schools it oversaw were at-risk. In the same year, 75% of students were identified as economically disadvantaged.  

A coalition of dozens of community organizations across D.C. have [called on the District]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/04/09/dc-schools-at-risk-kids/) to expand the definition of "at-risk," to include undocumented students, adult learners, and students with incarcerated parents. 

In the absence of institutional support, community-based organizations have had to step in to address an expansive need that has emerged over the pandemic. For Matthews' organization, that meant, among other things, holding a series of six "healing circles" for Black and brown youth last summer. 

"We had a community healer come and work with 35 young people around ways to develop coping mechanisms and skills to cope with anxiety and depression and trauma and stress," said Matthews.

Although they are constrained by limited funding, Matthews said that they have tried to keep up those supports throughout the year. She said that this summer she hopes to continue to help the students she works with through more healing circles.
