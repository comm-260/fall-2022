Kayla Kunkel, a 23-year-old woman with autism, was found not breathing on June 29, 2019 in Chenango, New York. She could not be revived and ultimately passed away. Her death was attributed to a bowel obstruction that never received medical attention. 

Her parents, Renee and Edward Kunkel, were indicted on felony counts of second-degree manslaughter, first-degree endangering the welfare of an incompetent or physically disabled person and on two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

Renee [​​pleaded guilty](https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/public-safety/2021/05/27/broome-woman-autism-negligent-homicide/7421175002/) to negligent homicide and was sentenced to five years of probation.

In the U.S., the perpetrators of filicides against disabled victims tend to receive less severe punishments, with only 24 percent of cases from 2019-2021 resulting in a sentence or conviction, and with those who do get convicted tending to receive shorter sentences for their crimes.

“We see the same pattern repeating over and over again,” said the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) in their [2022 Anti-Filicide Toolkit](https://autisticadvocacy.org/projects/community/mourning/anti-filicide/). “A parent kills their disabled child. The media portrays these murders as justifiable and inevitable due to the ‘burden’ of having a disabled person in the family. If the parent stands trial, they are given sympathy and comparatively lighter sentences, if they are sentenced at all. The victims are disregarded, blamed for their own murder at the hands of the person they should have been able to trust the most, and ultimately forgotten. And then the cycle repeats.”

## **Filicide at a Glance**

Filicide is largely used as a term to mean when a parent murders their child. However, within the disability community, the word takes on a less exclusive meaning and is used to describe when any relative, household member or caregiver kills their disabled relative, whether through a direct act of violence or through neglect. 

An analysis of ASAN [index](https://disability-memorial.org/index-by-year) entries from 2019-2021 showed that filicides against disabled individuals occurred most frequently in Florida, with a total of 15 cases taking place there during that time window. This was followed closely by Texas with 13 cases, and New York with 12.

The most common age group among the victims were children and teens, which together made up 36 percent of victims from 2019-2021. Elders, the term used to classify adults over 60 in the index, made up 34 percent of victims, and those remaining were adults under 60.

The most common suspect-victim relationship was a parent or guardian, accounting for 40 percent of the cases. 

Thirty-eight percent of cases fell under the category of homicide, followed by fatal neglect, which made up 25 percent of cases. The most common cause of death was a gunshot.

While the types of disabilities victims had varied widely, the most common was autism, followed by dementia. 

The U.S. does not specifically track demographic information such as the disability statuses of victims in their crime data, but other non-government organizations do. ASAN created and updates their index by pulling information about crimes that occur and are reported by news outlets. Information such as the name of the victim, their age, disabilities, cause of death, location of death, the case status and other details about the case are compiled into a profile. From 2019 to 2021, ASAN logged 182 cases of filicide where a victim was disabled. 

The index also acts as a memorial website, and entries often include pictures of the victim and occasionally some details about their life and personality.

However, because entries within the index are so dependent on the media covering cases in the first place, it is possible that cases are going underreported.

“Sometimes nondisabled parents of disabled people are seen as these heroes for essentially accommodating the bare minimum for disabled children,” said Julia Metraux, a freelance health reporter. “So if the disabled person dies, and they're like, Oh, well, this poor hero lost their kid, they're not really looking to it.”

Lack of representation in news coverage has also led to a dearth of knowledge among the general public about the prevalence of filicide against members of the disabled community.

“The general public has no idea how common it is,” said Autistic writer and editor Maxfield Sparrow. “Whenever I tell people that just in my Google notifications, I learned about an average of one filicide [of] an Autistic child or adult per month, at first they are disbelieving because they think well, if it were that common, wouldn't I have heard of it? But unless there's a big court trial, it ends up being a little article on a back page.”

## **Differences in Punishment**

Disability activists and other members of the disability community have preached for years that the way the filicides of disabled people are prosecuted lead to inequitable punishments for their perpetrators, with some not receiving punishment at all. 

“Often justice isn't being served in the courtroom,” Sparrow said. “When I go and look at cases that I've followed for years and see the outcomes, it's almost universally infuriating and disappointing to see how light the sentences are.”

While cases of filicide against disabled individuals have low sentence and conviction rates across the board, the severity of the sentences when they are handed down tend to vary by state, according to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.  

In 2019, out of the filicides that resulted in a sentence in Arizona, the [average sentence](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/state-district-circuit/2019/az19.pdf) length for cases that fell under the category of “murder” was 228 months. That same year, the average murder sentence in Arizona was 268 months and 255 months in the U.S. overall. 

In 2020, the average sentence for murder in Minnesota was 266 months and 255 months nationally. For filicides with a disabled victim for that year, the average sentence in Minnesota was 128 months.

Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina and Pennsylvania all followed similar trends.

However, when it came to 2019 filicides that were classified as “manslaughter” in Arizona, [sentences were longer](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/state-district-circuit/2019/az19.pdf) than the national and state averages, which was a common trend among other states with manslaughter sentences for filicides with a disabled victim.

## **The Cycle Continues**

It has been theorized that the reason why filicides involving a disabled victim are prosecuted less frequently and less harshly than other murder cases is because of a narrative that centers the perpetrator as the burnt out caregiver who was overwhelmed by the disabled victim.

“I think the media does have a role in [punishment] because the more that it's presented as an understandable tragedy for the parent, not for the murdered person, the more a court is going to think about their assumptions about what all parents must feel, and just a normalization of the killing,” Sparrow said.

When it comes to the murders of disabled older adults by their caregivers or spouses, specifically older adults with dementia, one of the pervasive narratives found in media portrayals of cases is that the victim’s life was not worth living, and as a result the perpetrator gets shown in a more positive light.

“You sometimes see with aging couples is that people jump to the conclusion that the person with dementia, their life wasn't worth living, essentially, and that [the caregiver] probably did a good thing, which I think is horrible,” said Metraux. “I think multiple things can be true at once. Caregivers can be burned out, but murder is not an excuse for burnout.”

When disabled children become victims of filicide, a common media narrative is that they were too stressful for their parent or caregiver to handle, therefore justifying their murder. 

“There is a societal attitude about what it means to have a disabled child, and a lot of people view disabled children as disappointing burdens,” Sparrow said. “When there is a news story that's online, and you go into the comment section, you will see lots and lots of people, including parents, defending the parent who has killed their child on the grounds that you can't possibly understand how hard it is to be a parent of a disabled child if you haven't done it, so don't pass judgment on this person. As if somehow the the difficulty that disabled children represent justifies murder in some way.”

Dismantling the narratives around filicide is thought to be a step toward more equitable treatment of cases from the general public and the justice system. Some have emphasized the point of ensuring that stories center the disabled person, not the nondisabled caregiver.

“We see journalists talking to largely nondisabled parents about their disabled kid or a disabled family member, and not actually including the voices of disabled people themselves,” Metraux said. 

“We need to talk more about who they were like,” Sparrow said. “Who are these people that we’re losing? What did they love? Who did they love? And how did they live? Because the more that people can see that these aren't just a whole bunch of disabled people murdered in gruesome ways, but genuine human beings with likes and dislikes and dreams, aims and hopes, the more people are going to care that we're getting killed.”
