Now more than ever, people are struggling to handle the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 on teens and young adults have left many scarred with anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues.
Reports of students' mental health declining pre-pandemic when paired with isolation, switches to online learning, and country-wide social upheaval led many to seek out mental health services to help them cope.

Based on this visualization based on data from the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors (AUCCCD), it can be seen that many students reached out to their school counseling centers for specific issues; the highest percentages among them being for anxiety, stress, and depression. However, for many students, this hasn't been an easy task.
[Lack of licensed therapists](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/11/anxiety-depression-treatment) able to take on new clients can be cited as a reason why many turned to their school's services instead. 
However, based on student testimony, it seems as though many counseling services are ill-equipped to handle the amount of students seeking their services. This is especially because nearly all universities and colleges have returned to in-person learning and, thus, have the ability to conduct face-to-face mental health aid. 
Though there is little data yet to be revealed on the ways in which the 2021-2022 in-person school year has impacted counseling centers, there seems to be less prominence placed on students' mental well being as things begin to open and they adjust to the "new normal". 

## College-Aged Student's Mental Health Pre and Post Pandemic
The AUCCCD does an annual survey in which they assess how many students use the counseling services on campuses and how they are utilized. In their [2018-2019 survey](https://www.aucccd.org/assets/documents/Survey/2019%20AUCCCD%20Survey-2020-05-31-PUBLIC.pdf), it was reported that, on average, 12.2% more clients were served in 2019 than in 2018. Similarly, centers offered, on average, 12.3% more appointments in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Based on information from this survey, universities (of varying sizes) found that on average, 11.6% of student bodies utilize their school's counseling services. Schools reported that anxiety and depression were among their top treated cases within the counseling centers.

The data above reflects some of the largest numbers of students utilizing mental health services than there have been in years. The declining state of students' mental health pre-pandemic definitely can have an effect on how they personally handled the isolation and stress that came with it. This is why the 2021-2022 school year, which has been mostly in person for many schools, can indicate the ways in which the virus could've hindered their progress. 
In the AUCCCD survey of 2020-2021, however, results looked much different than the years prior. Only about 8.6% of any school's student body was reported to be using counseling services. 
The majority of centers saw a decrease in demand during 2020-2021, 3% saw no change, and less than one-third of centers saw an increase in demand. Reasoning for this can be attributed to the fact that nearly [84%](https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/06_16_2021.asp) of institutions switched to online learning during this time. Because of this, many students were home and disincentivized from seeking online help. 
This could also have to do with accessibility issues that student's faced in getting in touch with their school's mental health services. Students who felt disconnected from their schools and didn't know enough about their services perhaps didn't know to reach out or that that was an option for them.

Based on this data, it is seen that there is a trend with smaller schools treating a larger population of their student body as opposed to bigger schools. This could be due to lack of accessibility provided at l
In 2020, The American Psychological Association conducted a [survey](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/11/telehealth-survey-summary.pdf) in which they found a 74% increase in psychologists treating patients with anxiety disorders and a 60% increase in treating those with depressive disorders. Based on this information from years ago, this could show an attempted switch from campus counseling centers to private practices.

## American University Counseling Center Example
Recalling his experience in trying to get in contact with American University's counseling center, a student by the name of Gage (class of 2024) said that he waited over a month to hear back from them in order to schedule a preliminary appointment. "It was just really frustrating," he said. "I needed help and I felt like they didn't even care enough to get back to me." 
Fanta Aw, the Vice President of Campus Life & Inclusive Excellence at American University (AU) issued a [statement](https://www.american.edu/ocl/s2020-mental-health.cfm) in 2020 regarding the then current state of their counseling services. In it, they said, "Satisfaction scores for the Center are high, with 97.5% reporting they would recommend the Counseling Center to a friend." However, they went on to say, "a number of students have frustrations related to accessÉ Around 20% of all appointments made at the Counseling Center this Fall were not attended." 
After calling AU's counseling center to see how these numbers had changed over the 2021-2022 school year, they were unable to respond. 
Additionally, the office of the Dean of Students at AU has consistently said that they are supportive of assisting students with their academic responsibilities (providing they can provide proper documentation of mental health issues). In regards to how the Dean of Students handled her mental health issues in the spring of 2022, Angelina (sophomore, class of 2024) said, "Although the dean was extremely kind, I ultimately was left doing the work to make sure I had the accommodations I need, even though I provided a note from a psychiatrist." She continued by saying, "It was my teachers who actually helped meÉ the dean actually just stressed me out and caused me to [do] extra work that didn't serve a purpose."

## Conclusion
Though the world has truly begun to open back up (so to speak), many are still handling the ways in which the pandemic has affected them and their mental health. Specifically for students, it is very overwhelming to reenter academia after being apart from it for so long. Despite the fact that things are going back to "normal", it is imperative that universities and colleges continue to be sympathetic to students suffering from mental health issues following the pandemic. Despite the decrease of services in the 2020-2021 school year, these institutions must still have the goal of ensuring their students overall well being and not just with academics.
