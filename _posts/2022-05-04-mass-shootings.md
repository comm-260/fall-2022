More people are affected by witnessing mass shootings every day, especially as more death-related incidents arise. The FBI defines mass shootings as a set of firearm and homicide incidents with "4 or more victims," says Tulane University Criminology Professor W. Allen. Despite the number of people involved, mass shootings are difficult to interpret. The 2010s were notable for increased deaths because of U.S. mass shootings. Many U.S. cities and states have seen significant changes in mass shooting deaths based on the public's awareness of them. However, those trends have continued to increase during the early 2020s, creating different causes for fewer or more deaths. 

### There were 22.73 percent more U.S. mass shootings and 11.48 percent more fatalities in 2021 than in 2009.

Throughout the 2010s, the number of U.S. mass shootings and deaths of victims drastically increased. Everytown Research and Policy reported a 22.73 percent increase in U.S. mass shooting incidents between 2009 and 2021 (https://everytownresearch.org/maps/mass-shootings-in-america/). However, the data also shows changes in trends. The number of incidents between 2009 and 2015 alternated between fewer and more mass shootings every year. 2010 and 2014 decreased to 15 mass shooting incidents, whereas 2011 and 2013 saw significant increases to 24 mass shooting incidents. Since 2017, U.S. mass shootings have increased, the most being 29 in 2019, following more decreases and increases between 2018 and 2021.

The incidents during this timeframe also saw increases and decreases in the fatalities of victims. Although Everytown Research and Policy reported an 11.48 increase in U.S. mass shooting fatalities, some downward trends in mass shooting deaths after 2011 reoccurred. There were moderate mass shooting deaths between 2011 at 115 and 2013 at 112. However, an increase to 161 deaths, with alternating patterns afterward, showed that more victims died from U.S. mass shootings due to a rise in incidents.  

Changes in mass shooting incidents and deaths happen for many reasons. For instance, social media makes mass shooting deaths more widespread to the public. One's awareness of increased numbers can change when being exposed to more coverage about "increases in mass shootings in the media," says UCLA gun violence Professor Ron Avi Astor. With more U.S. mass shooting incidents and deaths having media coverage in the late 2010s, more people have become aware of how frequently they occur. 

### There was an increase of 27 percent deaths in total deaths between January, February, and March of 2022 and 2019.

Furthermore, other studies suggest U.S. mass shooting deaths have increased despite incidents happening less frequently after the 2010s. Gun Violence Archive recently released statistics displaying increases and decreases in U.S. mass shooting deaths between 2019 and 2022. The months of January, February, and March have varied results in [mass shooting deaths](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/mass-shooting). However, all years have shown percentage increases and decreases. 2020 saw the least U.S. mass shooting deaths at 84, whereas 2021 recorded a 27 percent increase of 142 total U.S. mass shooting deaths. 2021 was also the only year to have higher U.S. mass shooting deaths. Gun Violence Archive's data shows varied results for how frequently mass shooting deaths occurred and the number of victims involved. 	  
But in 2021, other factors contributed to having the highest U.S. mass shooting death rates during those four years. Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Patrick Loftus says that increases in violent crime, gun violence, and homicides have contributed to many U.S. mass shooting deaths in 2021. Loftus says that "the number of killed victims in Washington, D.C. "soared to 226" people. There was also an increase of "2,410 firearms" used by people found in the streets of Washington, D.C. after gun violence rates surged, says Loftus. Many of the increased mass shooting deaths in 2021 were recorded based on how individuals are causing homicides in Washington D.C. The U.S. Homicides and U.S. mass shooting deaths primarily increased because small groups of "repeat violent offenders" were responsible for most of 2021's violent crimes, says Loftus. More mass shooting deaths were recorded with increased firearms use and homicides in 2021.  

### Montana and Florida saw more U.S. mass shooting deaths per state population during 2017 than in 2016.

Homicides from gun violence were also present in state mass shooting deaths. 2017 saw significant increases in mass shooting deaths across the U.S. compared to 2016. A 2020 report from The World Population Review shows higher U.S. mass shooting death rates between the [two years](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/mass-shootings-by-state). According to The World Population Review's analysis of increased U.S. mass shooting deaths from 2017, Montana experienced was ranked as the third-highest state at 22.5 deaths per state population, behind Alaska with 24.5 and Alabama with 22.9. While there were no drastic changes from 2016, with 18.9 deaths per state population, more victims were involved and killed in the mass shootings. Most of the deaths in Montana occurred from gun-related suicides and high gun ownership rates. Montana was ranked the highest of all 50 states, with 66.3 percent of mass shooting deaths.   

Additionally, Florida experienced similar circumstances to Montana with gun control regulations as there was an increase in mass shootings. The World Population Review reported a 32 percent "increase in gun deaths" in Florida. Many states, including Florida, later enforced stand your ground laws that let people use deadly force when it was necessary to defend against serious crimes. The laws have also contributed to more U.S. mass shooting deaths since they influenced people to "buy more guns at record rates," says Ron Avi Astor. In Florida's efforts to reduce gun violence, people potentially depended on victims retreating or other people dying to improve their gun control laws. Over time, deaths per Florida's state population showed a smaller increase from 12.2 to 12.3. Compared to Montana, Florida tried to enforce better gun control laws and had fewer victims die during mass shootings with gun violence. However, Montana still recorded higher death rates with their victims involved in gun-related deaths from homicide and suicide.  


### Newtown, Connecticut, had the highest fatality rate of 1405.52 per city population from mass shootings by white citizens.

Although many states saw increased deaths, increases in deaths, many U.S. cities have also recorded higher fatality rates from mass shootings. A Mother Jones study between 1982 and 2022 displays the shooters' motives, cases, and victims killed, contributing to [higher fatality rates](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/). For instance, Newtown, Connecticut, had the highest fatality rate, with 1405.52 fatalities per city population. The city's fatalities occurred during the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting. On December 14th, Adam Lanza murdered his mother, drove to Sandy Hook, and fatally shot 27 victims before taking his life. Although the motives remain unknown for the fatalities Lanza caused during Sandy Hook, its sum occurred at the fastest and highest rate. According to Mother Jones's data, many mass shootings were committed by "a terrorist attack" or some white individual shooting another person, says Robert W. Allen. Based on the motives of a white individual, most of the events, including Sandy Hook, involved white shooters targeting specific individuals and groups. Connecticut, and many other states, later enforced gun laws that let people use handguns and long guns.  

Moreover, other states enforced similar gun control laws from the effects of fatalities in Newtown, Connecticut, and different people's motives for their occurrences. The 2009 Fort Hood, Texas massacre resulted in the killing of 16 citizens with 68.66 fatalities per city population at a U.S. military installation. Unlike Newtown, Fort Hood was an "Isis directed shooting" caused by a Palestinian shooter who carried a semi-automatic pistol and wanted to kill the installed soldiers, says Robert W. Allen. Likewise, another mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, saw a white man killing many African Americans at a local church, accumulating 6.57 fatalities per city population. Many fatalities per city population happened from whites and Isis-controlled groups having the drive to kill other individuals. All three situations represent cities wanting to change their gun laws so that the shooters do not have the means to target specific people.   


Over time, the increase in mass shooting incidents has led to more deaths in many U.S. cities and states. 2009 and 2021 displayed upward and downward trends in U.S. mass shooting incidents. However, mass shooting deaths became more public after receiving increased coverage on social media. Gun Violence Archive's data between 2019 and 2022 displays constant changes in U.S. mass shooting deaths from homicides and increased use of firearms. In all the U.S. states, Montana had the highest mass shooting deaths between 2016 and 2017. Many of the victims in Montana's mass shootings were involved in gun-related suicides. In contrast to Montana, Florida saw increased gun ownership among individuals and enforced more protective gun control laws. Mother Jones's research shows that Sandy Hook made Newtown, Connecticut, and other U.S. cities change their gun control laws to deter the harm of other individuals and groups. More U.S. citizens have died from involvement in mass shootings when observing changes in gun-control laws, homicide incidents, and death rates. The data calls for better gun-control laws to avoid the higher death rates that led to all mass shootings in the 2010s.
