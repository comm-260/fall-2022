Low voter turnout is terrible and complex issue, but one of the forgotten factors which leads to a stateÕs lower voter turnout is the lack of decent broadband internet coverage.

In states with lower broadband coverage, we can also see lower turnout rates. Of course, there are other conflating factors as well, but broadband is one critical piece which is almost always overlooked. Low internet availability plays a key role in lack of voter awareness.

Notice the states with lower voter turnout. What do they all have in common? They tend to be more rural. There are many factors which may contribute to this being the case, but letÕs take a deeper dive into the issues caused by limited or no internet access.

Kirk Martin, Interim Executive Director of the [Oklahoma Broadband Office](https://oklahoma.gov/broadband/council.html), detailed the extent of the problem in the case of healthcare and related issues in an interview on Tuesday afternoon.

ÒI had a conversationÉwith two individuals running a multi-county healthcare system in the southeastern part of the stateÉthe lack of availability of high-speed internet connecting their hospitals and care facilities is a real limitation on the kind of service that they could deliver. It increases their costs because they couldnÕt do telehealth effectively in many instances, so they had to provide that service in other means that were more expensive, whether thatÕs transporting the patient to the hospital, or doing some sort of outreach on the part of the healthcare system.Ó

A lack of internet access produces issues in transportation (related and unrelated to healthcare), healthcare itself, education, and more. It stands to reason that voting would fall by the wayside in the case that transportation, online registration, and information on candidates are not readily available. 

Ò[These] anecdotes are probably not all that uncommon across the country. WeÕre hoping to make those memories instead of reality.Ó Said Interim Director Martin.

The Oklahoma Broadband Expansion Council formed in May of 2020, and they are not the only state to have taken this step in recent years. The Arkansas Broadband Development Group was established in 2015, and West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council was established in 2016. One mission of these councils is to advocate for accurate data collection from the FCC, which has historically released inaccurate reflections of broadband coverage.

Interim Director Martin described, ÒWeÕve had an interesting thing with the release of the FCC National Broadband MapÉPeople can put in their address and seeÉwhat kind of service they have at their address, and theyÕre finding that sometimes itÕs overstated versus what their experience is. And so they can do individual challenges.Ó

That is, individual households can submit speed tests to the FCC, to prove that their coverage is not what the commission claims. According to Interim Director Martin, the Oklahoma Broadband Expansion Council can also do ÒbulkÓ challenges, though these seem to be harder to execute and be taken into account with the FCC.

Concerning the issues with the FCC data, representatives like Sen. Joe Manchin and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, both from West Virginia, have tried to back the efforts of their stateÕs broadband office. The Senators have both publicly voiced concerns over the FCCÕs announced data and have encouraged West Virginians to challenge it. 

In a recent statement, Sen. Capito said, ÒThese maps, which I have long advocated and also provided funds for, will ultimately play a critical role in our efforts to bridge the digital divide, which is why I will be continuing to work with the FCC to see that West Virginians are accurately represented on these maps. In the meantime, please visit the FCCÕs map page to make sure your address is accurately represented.Ó

## State Data

In Arkansas, there is a stark relation between broadband and voter turnout. The state is broken down into 4 congressional districts, each with unique demographic and geographic qualities. 

District 1 is mostly made up of the Mississippi delta region, which is primarily rural, in combination with outer sprawl from ArkansasÕs urban core. District 2 is the urban core of Arkansas, containing the cities of Little Rock and Pine Bluff. District 3 is characterized by growing suburban counties, and isolated rural regions. Finally, District 4 is distinctly rural, and contains the largest percentage of minorities of any district at roughly 30%.

The data holds that all districts comply with the notion that higher broadband subscriptions correlate with relatively higher voter turnout, with the exception of District 4. District 4 is a notable outlier because it has the highest turnout of any district, yet the lowest percentage of households with broadband subscriptions. It is, however, an outlier. District 4 having roughly a roughly 30% minority population, many of them living in rural regions which may subject them to more systematic disenfranchisement of internet access, could explain the low connectivity rates, and the higher voter turnout.

## In the End

It is clear that there is at least a significant correlation between the issue of broadband internet access and low voter turnout. The data shows that at the macro and micro levels, national and state, there is a significant impact on voter turnout due to lack of connectivity in certain regions. States such as Arkansas display this on a more local level, that of congressional districts, and the idea holds true. And on the national level, as exemplified by the voter turnout and household internet access data, the issue is even more noticeable.
