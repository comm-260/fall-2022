Daniel Matos would like to ride his bike to work tomorrow morning, but it was stolen from outside his apartment on November 21. He’s not the only one, either. 

Bike thefts in the district area are up 28% since last year, likely as a direct result of nationwide bike shortages due to high demand and limited supply.

Matos had been riding to work instead rather than taking public transportation and risk a coronavirus infection. “I don’t want to take the Metro or a bus every day. That’s too much exposure,” he said. 

Jay Crockett, who works at multiple locations of Conte’s bike shop, said he’s noticed an uptick in bike thefts in the greater Washington area. He theorized that this was the result of the shortage of new bikes. But the bikes he does have in stock aren’t exactly affordable. 

## Buyers rejoice 

The walls of Conte’s bike shop in Cathedral heights are laced with intimidating Italian road racing bikes commanding prices of $7,000 and up. 

Crockett said most riders who would normally be looking under the $3,000 range (generally not commuters) are now “starting to explore things that are up there a little bit further in price around $3,000 to 6,000 range.” It’s an expensive hobby. 

According to a [report](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2020/cycling-industry-sales-growth-accelerates-in-april/) by the NPD group, which analyzes consumer data, total April bicycle sales hit $1 billion, compared to a typical April average of $550 and $575 million.

Even the resale market has exploded, with parts and complete bikes sometimes selling more than what they were worth new on sites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, Crockett said.  

But it’s hard to say whether the pandemic’s effects on bike sales have been more of a blessing or a curse for shops. On the one hand, everyone wants a bike, but on the other, there are none left and they’ve all been sold out since April. 

Part of the problem is with suppliers. Michael Button, an employee of popular bike manufacturer Specialized, said, globally, bike supply has fallen far behind. “Factories have shut down, and they were never made to handle this much off-season demand anyway,” he said. 

“Every shop in the nation, everybody in North America, everybody in the global market, everybody's sort of doing the same thing of trying to get parts, sourcing them from places that are traditionally unconventional,” said Crockett. “The industry as a whole hasn't seen a surge in sales and service traffic like this since probably the early 2010s.” 

“We’ve still got bikes on the way, they’re just coming a little later,” Button said. “2021 models will likely be on the shelves alongside discounted 2020 models that didn’t make it in time.” 

While sales are lagging behind, as of November, which is late in the season, bike shops like Conte’s have mostly been seeing service take the largest share of their revenue. 

The floor of the shop is filled with used bikes waiting for repair. Turnaround time was often multiple few weeks in the summer time, according to another Conte’s employee’s estimate.

## Buyers’ remorse 

With bikes supplies low and sale prices high, bicycle thieves have upgraded their methods. “We’re starting to see a lot of angle-grinder stuff,” Crockett said, referring to thieves’ use of high powered saws to free bikes of their locks. 

“I went outside Monday morning to find my bike missing. They cut through the lock, there was nothing left except for the lock,” said Matos. 

Matos bought the bike a few years ago and he’s not ready to give it up. He’s reported the theft bike to sites like bikeindex.org and Facebook lost and found groups in the hopes that someone will spot his ride. 

If you live in Adams Morgan, Shaw or in the downtown area be on high alert. Your new (or old) bike might be stolen. Property thefts from these neighborhoods saw the most bike thefts in August.

Crockett, from Conte’s bike shop, also manages several Washington-local bike recovery pages online. “The amount of people requesting the join some of these groups on Facebook... it’s just out of the water, I'm getting probably 10 to 15 requests a day,” he said. 

He estimates an increase in thefts anywhere from 58% to 63%, although analysis of the data from bikeindex.org suggests a more modest increase of 28% since 2019. 

## Tips on finding (and keeping) a bike 

Crockett said that, while Conte’s shelves are starting to fill up again, the best place to buy a bike is still likely secondhand, through Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. 

He recommended inspecting a bike thoroughly before buying it ─ you don’t want to get home and find that catastrophic damage renders the bike useless. 
Be careful what color you pick, too. Buying a black or gray bike might not be the best idea, given the frequency of which they are stolen, according to bikeindex.org data.

As for keeping your new bike safe, it’s best to keep it inside if possible. Otherwise, making sure to lock it properly is important. “You want to lock the wheels to the frame and the frame to the bike rack or something that’s not going anywhere,” Crockett said. 

Crockett said thieves are “seeing people come home with new bikes, flashy bikes,” and taking the opportunity to steal them. He recounted one story of a high-end $12,000 bike stolen from a supposedly secure bike locker in an apartment in the district recently. 

The Metropolitan Police Department, who rejected a request for comment, recommends locking your bike in a secure location, [registering](https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/bicycle-registration-district-columbia) your bike and calling 911 as soon as your bike is stolen. You can visit their [website](https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/bikes-and-helmet-safety) for more tips and riding safety. 

Miracles do happen, of course. A woman from the Netherlands “had her bike stolen here in DC when she was traveling,” said Crockett, and a local bike shop found it and “were more than happy to cover the cost of shipping and back to her,” he said. 

Hopefully, Matos will find the same luck.
