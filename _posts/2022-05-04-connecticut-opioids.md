Jessica Morris remembers playing with baby dolls at five years old, promising herself that she would never let a substance use problem like her mother’s prevent her from being a good parent to the children she hoped to have someday.

Now a mother of three and nearly ten years into sustained recovery from an opioid addiction, Morris is helping residents of eastern Connecticut keep their own promises of achieving sobriety. In a rural section of the state where healthcare resources are scarcer, her work is much-needed — the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing issues surrounding access to mental health care and substance use treatment programs throughout the past two years.

Windham, the seat of Connecticut’s least-populated county, saw nearly one opioid use-related death for every 1,000 of its residents in 2020, according to data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Despite having the lowest population of any Connecticut county, Windham County saw the second-highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the state in 2020, at 42 deaths per every 100,000 residents.

Morris recently started as a recovery coach for Perception Programs, a non-profit organization that offers substance addiction treatment services in Windham County, with behavioral health centers and inpatient rehabilitation facilities in Danielson, Storrs and Willimantic. 

“People who use drugs are people, period, and they have the same needs pretty much anywhere you go,” Morris said. “The resources just get more and more scarce unfortunately, and the access is more limited obviously because it’s just so rural, remote and spread out.”

Windham County is home to only two acute care hospitals, Windham Community Memorial Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital, which puts local substance abuse treatment clinics in a critical position as far as addressing the area’s opioid crisis. According to Erin Joudrey, the chief organization operations officer at Perception Programs, staffing shortages brought on by the pandemic have made it more difficult to fill this role.

“I have been in the field for 20-something years and I have never, ever seen such a lack of interest in people applying for open positions, clinician positions, everything across the board,” said Erin Joudrey, the chief organization operations officer for Perception Programs. “If you can’t fill your clinician positions, you can’t serve people.”

Joudrey said it is crucial to enroll patients in addiction treatment programs as soon as they express interest in sobriety, but the lack of Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) in the area hinders this process.

“Some of the people we’ve worked with who have died — there have been some cases where we had just convinced them but we couldn’t get them an appointment for, like, three weeks,” Joudrey said. “And so they continue to use and then it increases the risk [of an overdose].” 

While the pandemic limited space in health care facilities nationwide in 2020, even in 2019, only five people who died of an opioid overdose in Windham County were in a medical facility (including hospitals, convalescent homes, hospices, and nursing homes) at their time of death, representing roughly 12 percent of the county’s 42 overdose deaths that year. This figure represents a disparity between the Windham region and more populated parts of the state — the same year in Hartford County, 28 percent of opioid-related deaths occurred in medical facilities; in New Haven County, 33 percent.

Beyond the shortage of local hospital beds and staff members who are equipped to treat opioid addiction, Morris added that infrastructure in these more rural places makes it difficult for people to access both health services and other resources that are essential to recovery. In particular, she noted extremely limited public transportation systems and a lack of affordable housing in the area.

While one might think that the pivot to telehealth operations during the pandemic could promote access for people without reliable transportation, Joudrey said that this actually presented a new challenge for Perception Programs.

“People living in this part of the state have less access to the appropriate types of devices,” Joudrey said. “Our folks don’t have iPads and laptops and iPhones hanging around — many of them have flip phones still, so while we were able to continue to provide this service, we definitely saw a drop in the number of people we were serving because they just still could not access the service.”

To mitigate overdose deaths in a county where such obstacles pave the road to accessibility, Joudrey and Morris both stressed the importance of their organization’s provision of same-day Suboxone prescriptions to individuals who express need. Suboxone, the brand name of a drug that combines buprenorphine and naloxone, treats opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms by blocking opioid receptors in the brain.

Joudrey said that offering this service at Perception Programs has been an “uphill climb.”

“We haven’t served as many people as we would have hoped we would have served by now,” Joudrey said, noting it has been “difficult to engage” nearby Windham Community Memorial Hospital in a partnership that would allow them to transfer patients in need of Suboxone directly to Perception Programs.

“Our local hospitals are owned by Hartford Healthcare, which are big conglomerate businesses, and it’s harder to sneak your way in when you’re not part of that system,” Joudrey said.

With funding support from the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Perception Programs has established Connecticut’s fifth mobile Suboxone distribution clinic, which the organization expects to start operations within the next month. 

The mobile clinic will take the form of a van that Joudrey said will park in two to three sites in the Windham and New London County areas regularly each week. Recovery coaches like Morris will be present to talk with local residents about their drug use, and will have the ability to immediately reach telehealth providers on a computer at the clinic site to fill Suboxone prescriptions whenever interest is expressed.

The mobile clinic will also distribute Narcan — a medication that acts quickly to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose — and offer training on how to administer it.

“We’ll park at the train tracks, we’ll park at encampments, we’ll go wherever we know people are,” Joudrey said.

Morris said that, based on what she has seen during her time working in Windham County and neighboring New London County, this program allows recovery coaches like her to “literally [meet] the client where they’re at” without “telling them what to do, what they should do, what they need to do — just like, ‘Hey, what do you want to do about your drugs and how can I help?’” 

Providing prompt, convenient care is personal to Morris, whose son’s father died of an opioid overdose in Windham County three years ago. 

“I guarantee my son’s father did not think that was going to be his last time [using opioids],” Morris said. “He thought he could do it differently this time — just one more time, you know? And that desire to use can be all-encompassing and fully debilitating for some.” 

Other community stakeholders in Windham County are also focused on addressing opioid use, including Windham Technical High School. According to the school’s spokesperson Kerry Markey, Windham’s entire public school district has introduced “educational initiatives” to promote prevention. This includes a comprehensive health education course that students take from freshman to senior year, exploring what Windham Tech’s website describes as “how knowledge and behavior contribute to reducing one’s risk for unintentional injury and disease.” 

As far as Perception Programs’s work goes, Joudrey identified harm reduction as the team’s main goal. Going forward, she said the organization is concentrating on two clear objectives as they face the future of the opioid crisis in rural Connecticut: to increase access for same-day Suboxone services and decrease wait times for services. 

Morris echoed this sentiment, additionally advocating for the introduction of local supervised injection centers for opioid users to ensure clean needles and access to prepared medical personnel in the event of overdose. She said this sort of service would contribute to what she described as “the end goal” in terms of the opioid crisis: fewer deaths and thus, more chances for recovery.

“I just want people to live long enough to make a different choice,” Morris said.
